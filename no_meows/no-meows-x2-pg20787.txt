PREFACE
       







This book, like the others in this Part, makes no pretense at
         ,                             ,                     

originality. The author has studied and compared a considerable number
           .                                                          

of works by the best authorities on the subject and has endeavored to
                                                                     

adapt the best of their contents to the use of printers' apprentices.
                                                       '            .

Every author has his own set of rules. At first sight, each set appears
                                     .               ,                 

inconsistent with those given by other writers. This inconsistency,
                                              .                   ,

however, is generally more apparent than real. It arises from
       ,                                     .               

differences in point of view, method of approach, and system of
                            ,                   ,              

classification.
              .




An attempt has been made to compile from these sources a set of rules
                                                                     

which would bring before the pupil a correct and comprehensive view of
                                                                      

the best current usage, well illustrated by examples and accompanied by
                      ,                                                

practical typographical hints. The fact has been kept steadily in mind
                             .                                        

that this book is intended for a certain definite class of pupils and no
                                                                        

pains have been spared to fit it to their needs.
                                               .




Any treatise consisting, as this one necessarily does, mainly of rules
                       ,                             ,                

is practically useful only as a basis for constant and persistent drill.
                                                                       .

It is, of course, valuable for reference, but the emergencies of the
     ,          ,                       ,                           

day's work leave no time for consultation. These rules must be learned,
   '                                     .                            ,

and not only learned but assimilated so that their correct application
                                                                      

becomes instinctive and instantaneous. This result can be secured only
                                     .                                

by practice. Hence the emphasis laid on the exercises indicated in the
           .                                                          

paragraphs introductory to the review questions.

PUNCTUATION
           













INTRODUCTION
            







Punctuation is a device by which we aid words to tell their story. Words
                                                                 .      

have done this at times without such aid, and may now do so, but at
                                        ,                  ,       

constant risk of serious misunderstanding. This can be easily seen by
                                         .                           

reading the following lines printed as they would have been written in

Probably this particular passage could be read without danger of serious
                                                                        

misunderstanding. The two well-known passages which follow, however, are
                .             -                           ,        ,    

cases where either a simple statement may become a ridiculous travesty
                                                                      

or a serious arraignment may become a eulogy by punctuation.
                                                           .




Punctuate the following so as to express two very different meanings:
                                                                    :




    Lord Palmerston then entered on his head a white hat upon his feet
                                                                      

    large but well polished boots upon his brow a dark cloud in his hand
                                                                        

    a faithful walking stick in his eye a menacing glare saying nothing.
                                                                       .




Punctuate the following in two ways: one to represent a very bad man,
                                   :                                ,

and the other a very good man:
                             :




    He is an old man and experienced in vice and wickedness he is never
                                                                       

    found in opposing the works of iniquity he takes delight in the
                                                                   

    downfall of his neighbors he never rejoices in the prosperity of his
                                                                        

    fellow-creatures he is always ready to assist in destroying the

    peace of society he takes no pleasure in serving the Lord he is
                                                                   

    uncommonly diligent in sowing discord among his friends and
                                                               

    acquaintances he takes no pride in laboring to promote the cause of
                                                                       

    Christianity he has not been negligent in endeavoring to stigmatize
                                                                       

    all public teachers he makes no effort to subdue his evil passions
                                                                      

    he strives hard to build up satans kingdom he lends no aid to the
                                                                     

    support of the gospel among the heathen he contributes largely to
                                                                     

    the devil he will never go to heaven he must go where he will

The most ancient inscriptions and manuscripts are merely strings of

The first mark to be used was the dot, or period. Its original purpose

Sometimes a slanting mark (/) or a double dot (: or ..) was used to

After a time spaces were introduced to show the grouping of the letters

During the manuscript period different schools of copyists and even

The systematization of punctuation is due mainly to the careful and

For a very long time the chief concern of the printer was the opening of

meanings. The semicolon, for instance, is the Greek mark of

The period took its name from the Greek word [Greek: periodos],
                                             [     :         ],

The colon comes from the Greek [Greek: kôlon], kolon, meaning a limb.

The comma comes from the Greek [Greek: komma], komma, from [Greek:

The semicolon, of course, is the half colon.

The question mark was made by writing the first and last letters of the

The exclamation point was made by writing the letters of the Latin word

There are two systems of punctuation in use, known respectively as the
                                           ,                          

close and open systems. The close, or stiff, system, using points

every sort, such as laws, contracts, legal and ecclesiastical

statements, and the like. The open, or easy, system, omitting points

composition. The tendency, sometimes pushed too far, is toward an

printers may be summed up by saying that you must justify the use of a

But why should the printer bother himself about punctuation at all? Is
                                                                  ?   

that not the business of the author, the editor, and the proofreader?

Strictly speaking, yes, but authors generally neglect punctuation, copy

proofreader's corrections are expensive. It is therefore important that
           '                           .                               

the compositor should be intelligent about punctuation, whether he works

The question of how far the printer may go in changing or supplying the

punctuation marks are very different from rules for the use of purely

compositor from the necessity of thinking. Punctuation can never be

reduced to an exact science.
                           .




Certain general directions should be borne in mind by writers and

III. Pay constant attention to punctuation in everything you write.

anything that you do not understand.

THE COMMA
         







The comma is by far the most difficult of all the punctuation marks to

                                          .                             

stated and should be learned. Many cases, however, will arise in which
                            .           ,        ,                    

the rules will be differently interpreted and differently applied by

                .




The comma is the least degree of separation possible of indication in

     .

        .

the comma for the semicolon and of the semicolon for the colon. Compare

effects of the tendency will be easily seen. It is part of the general

tendency toward greater simplicity of expression which has developed the
                                                                        

clear and simple English of the best contemporary writers out of the

and involved style needs a good deal of punctuation to make it

This progressive change in the need for punctuation and in the attitude

The writer is always held to justification of the presence of a comma

writing needs some use of commas to indicate the sense and to prevent

Always remember that the real business of the comma is just that of
                                                                   

helping the meaning of the words and of preventing ambiguity by showing

following general principles:
                            :




I. The comma is used to separate for the eye what is separate in
 .                                                              

thought.

The comma is not intended to break the matter up into lengths suited to

line.

II. The sole purpose of the comma is the unfolding of the sense of the
  .                                                                   

words.

of the sense of the words.
                         .




IV. In case of doubt, omit the comma.

THE SEMICOLON
             







The semicolon is used to denote a degree of separation greater than that

members of the sentence. The semicolon is generally used in long

When a sentence ends with a quotation, the period always goes inside the

The same rule applies to the use of the other low marks, comma,

THE DASH
        







The dash is a very useful mark which has been greatly overworked by
                                                                   

careless writers. It is very easy to make in manuscript and serves as a
                .

properly be used.
                .




The conspicuousness of the dash makes it a very useful mark for guiding
                                                                       

the eye of the reader to the unity of the sentence. It is particularly

and great elaboration of detail. In such cases commas, semicolons, and

even parentheses are so multiplied that the relation of the clauses is

The dash is sometimes used to connect a side heading with the text that

French printers use the dash in printing dialogue as a partial

                               --                 .




3. To express in one sentence great contrariety of action or emotion or

In this connection DeVinne gives the following excellent example from

10. A dash preceded by a colon is sometimes used before a long quotation

dash in this way.
                .




Dashes are often used instead of marks of parenthesis. It is better to

let each mark do its own work.

THE PARENTHESIS
               







The parenthesis, commonly used in pairs, encloses expressions which have
               ,                       ,

sometimes introduced into a sentence to cast doubt on a statement or to
                                                                       

express surprise or contempt.

    He said that on the fifth of January (?) he was in New York.

    This most excellent (!) gentleman.

4. Parentheses are used, generally in pairs, sometimes singly, to
 .                     ,                   ,                 ,

classification in arguments or in precise statements.
                                                    .




    This is done because: (a) it is clearer; (b) it is shorter.
                        : ( )              ; ( )              .




These signs may be printed in several ways.

    (a) a) (^a) ^a) (1) 1) (^1) ^1)

The old-fashioned form of parenthesis, always made too thin, may need a
       -                             ,                     ,

( Hall ). The space may not be needed when the proximate character has a
(      ).

The italic form of parenthesis is objectionable in book work.
                                                            .

Distinction is sought for the word in italic and not for the parenthesis
                                                                        

enclosing the word. The italic parenthesis may be used in job-work or
                  .                                          -

THE BRACKET
           







Brackets are used in pairs, like the parentheses. In Job composition

convenient. In descriptive text matter, however, brackets should not be
          .                           ,        ,                       

used where parentheses are clearly indicated.
                                            .







_Rules for the Use of the Bracket_
                                  




1. To enclose words or phrases which are entirely independent of the
 .                                                                  

rest of the sentence.
                    .




The enclosed words are usually comments, queries, corrections,
                                       ,        ,            ,

criticisms, or directions inserted by some person other than the

2. To enclose passages of doubtful authenticity in reprints of early
 .                                                                  

manuscripts, special amendments to bills under legislative

              .




3. In legal or ecclesiastical papers to indicate numerical words which
 .                                                                    

may have to be changed, or to indicate where details are to be supplied.
                      ,                                                .

    The officers shall remain in office [_here state the time_] or until

    their successors are duly qualified.
                                       .




4. To avoid the confusion caused by a parenthesis within a parenthesis.
 .                                                                    .




5. A single bracket is used to enclose the ending of a long line of
 .

adjoining line.

Doubt whether to use parentheses or brackets can usually be settled by
                                                                      

this general principle:
                      :




Parentheses always enclose remarks apparently made by the writer of the
                                                                       

text. Brackets enclose remarks certainly made by the editor or reporter
    .

            .













THE INTERROGATION
                 







The interrogation is the point that asks questions. It should always be
                                                  .                    

placed outside quotation marks unless it is a part of the quotation
                                                                   

itself.
      .







_Rules for the Use of the Interrogation_
                                        




1. The interrogation point is used at the end of every direct question.
 .                                                                    .




    Are you there?
                 ?




Indirect questions, that is, statements that a question has been asked,
                  ,        ,                                          ,

    He asked me if I was there.
                              .

    He asked the question, Are you there? and received no answer.
                         ,              ?                       .




2. At the end of each of a series of questions thrown into a single
 .                                                                 

sentence.

                                    ?         ?           ?




3. The interrogation, like a certain inflection in the voice, may
 .                  ,                                       ,

THE EXCLAMATION
               







The exclamation mark is the mark of strong emotion.
                                                  .







_Rules for the Use of the Exclamation_
                                      




1. After every expression of great surprise or emotion.
 .                                                    .




    Look, my lord! it comes!
        ,        !         !

    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

    Alas! my father.
        !          .




2. After interjections and other exclamatory words.

    Hurrah! Good! Away! Oh!
          !     !     !   !




Where the exclamations are repeated without particularly emphasizing

    Ha, ha, ha! That's a good joke!
      ,   ,   !     '             !




O used as a vocative or to express a desire or imprecation does not call

    Oh, yes.
      ,    .

    O, that night would come!
     ,                      !




The exclamation is sometimes used in job printing to fill out a display
                                                                       

line or for other inadequate reasons. These uses should be avoided.
                                    .                             .













THE APOSTROPHE
              







The apostrophe is primarily the sign of the possessive case, but it has
                                                           ,           

several other uses.
                  .







_Rules for the Use of the Apostrophe_
                                     




1. The apostrophe for the possessive case is added only to nouns, not to
 .                                                              ,       

the pronouns, which have their distinct possessive forms. _Its_ is a
            ,                                           .           

possessive pronoun. _It's_ is an abbreviation for _it is_. Do not use an
                  .    '                                 .              

apostrophe with the possessive adjectives _hers_, _ours_, _yours_,
                                                ,       ,        ,

_theirs_, _its_.
        ,      .




2. All nouns in the singular and all nouns in the plural except those
 .                                                                   

ending in _s_ take an apostrophe and _s_ to form the possessive.
                                                               .




Nouns in the plural ending in _s_ take an apostrophe only to form the
                                                                     

possessive.
          .




There is much difference of opinion as to the invariability of the rule
                                                                       

concerning singular nouns in _s_. DeVinne advises following the
                                .                              

pronunciation. Where the second _s_ is not pronounced, as often happens,
             .                                       ,                 ,

to avoid the prolonged hissing sound of another _s_, he recommends
                                                   ,              

omitting it in print.
                    .




    Moses' hat, for Moses's hat.
         '    ,          '     .

    For conscience' sake.
                  '     .




3. The apostrophe indicates the omission of letters in dialect, in
 .                                                            ,   

familiar dialogue, and in poetry.

    That's 'ow 'tis.
        '  '   '   .

    'Twas ever thus.
    '              .




When two words are practically made into one syllable, a thin space may
                                                     ,                 

be put before the apostrophe, except that _don't_, _can't_, _won't_, and
                            ,                 '  ,     '  ,     '  ,    

_shan't_ are consolidated. This use of a space serves to distinguish
     '                   .                                          

between the possessive in _s_ and the contraction of _is_.

4. Figures expressing dates are often abbreviated, but it is not good

                   '  .




5. The apostrophe is used to form the plural of letters and figures.
 .                                                                 .

          '       '            .




Except in these cases the apostrophe is not a plural sign and should be
                                                                       

so used only when it is intended to reproduce a dialect or

pronunciation continued in common use in poetry long after it was

pronunciation was indicated by dropping the _e_ and using an apostrophe,
                                                                       ,

thus: _clos'd_, _belov'd_. It is now understood that while the full
    :      '  ,       '  .                                         

spelling is to be used, the old pronunciation is not to be used unless
                      ,                                               

specially indicated by placing a grave accent over the _e_ of the last
                                                                      

syllable, thus: _belovèd_.
        ,     :          .




At the same period poets, especially, used an apostrophe to indicate a
                        ,           ,                                 

silent _e_ as in _ev'ry_, but the usage is now obsolete.
                    '   ,                              .




Such abbreviations as _Dep't_, _Gov't_, _Sec'y_, and the like, are
                          '  ,     '  ,     '  ,             ,    

objectionable in print. If such abbreviations are necessary it is better
                      .                                                 

to use the forms _Dept._, _Govt._, _Secy._
                      . ,      . ,      . 













THE HYPHEN
          







The hyphen is used to join compound words; to mark the division of a
                                         ;                          

word too long to go entirely into one line; to separate the syllables of
                                          ;                             

words in order to show pronunciation; as a leader in tabular work. For
                                    ;                            .    

this last purpose the period is to be preferred to any other mark in
                                                                    

use. Tabular work without leaders is obscure and therefore
   .                                                      

objectionable.
             .













QUOTATION MARKS
               







Quotation marks are signs used to indicate that the writer is giving
                                                                    

exactly the words of another. A French printer named Morel used a comma
                            .                                          

in the outer margin to indicate a quoted line about 1550. About a
                                                        .        

century later another Frenchman, Ménage, introduced a mark («»)
                               ,       ,                   («»)

resembling a double parenthesis but shorter. These marks were cast on
                                           .                         

the middle of the type body so that they could be reversed for use at
                                                                     

either the beginning or the end of a quotation. The French have retained
                                              .                         

these signs as their quotation marks ever since.
                                               .




When the English adopted the use of quotation marks, they did not take
                                                   ,                  

over the French marks, but substituted two inverted commas at the
                     ,                                           

beginning and two apostrophes at the end of the quoted paragraph. These
                                                                .      

marks are typographically unsatisfactory. They are weak and therefore
                                        .                            

hardly adequate to their purpose in aiding the understanding through the
                                                                        

eye. Being cast on the upper part of the type body, they leave a blank
   .                                              ,                   

space below and thus impair the beauty of the line and interfere with
                                                                     

good spacing. Certain rules for the position of quotation marks when
            .                                                       

used with other marks are based upon these typographical considerations
                                                                       

rather than upon logical considerations.
                                       .







_Rules for the Use of Quotation Marks_
                                      




1. Every direct quotation should be enclosed in double quotation marks.
 .                                                                    .




    "I will go," said he, "if I can."
    "         ,"        , "        ."




Reports of what another person has said when given in words other than
                                                                      

his own are called indirect quotations and take no marks.
                                                        .




    He said he would go if he could.
                                   .




2. A quotation of several paragraphs requires quotation marks at the
 .                                                                  

beginning of each paragraph, but at the end of the last one only. In
                           ,                                    .   

legal documents, and sometimes elsewhere, quotations are defined and
               ,                        ,                           

emphasized by putting double commas at the beginning of every line of
                                                                     

the quotation.
             .




The same result may be better obtained by using smaller type, or
                                                            ,   

indenting the quotation, or both.
                       ,        .




3. A quotation included within another quotation should be enclosed by
 .                                                                    

single quotation marks.
                      .




    He said: "I heard him cry 'Put down that gun,' and then I heard a
           : "                '                 ,'                   

    shot."
        ."




4. Titles of books, essays, art works, etc., are usually enclosed in
 .                ,       ,          ,    .,                        

quotation marks. When the books are supposedly familiar to all readers,
               .                                                      ,

the marks are not used. You would not print "The Bible," "Paradise
                      .                     "         ," "        

Lost," "The Iliad."
    ," "         ."




The titles of books, etc., are sometimes printed in italics instead of
                   ,    .,                                            

being enclosed in quotation marks. This is a matter of office style
                                 .                                 

rather than of good or bad practice.
                                   .




5. In writing about plays or books, the name of the work may be quoted
 .                                ,                                   

and the name of a character italicized. This is done to avoid confusion
                                      .                                

between the play, the character, and the real person portrayed. "William
                ,              ,                              . "       

Tell" is a play. _William Tell_ is a character in fiction. William Tell
    "          .                                         .             

is a national hero of Switzerland.
                                 .




This usage is by no means uniform; here again, we are on the ground of
                                 ;           ,                        

office style.
            .




6. Names of vessels are sometimes quoted, sometimes italicized, and
 .                                      ,                     ,    

sometimes printed without distinguishing marks. Here we are once more on
                                              .                         

the ground of office style.
                          .




7. Sentences from a foreign language are usually enclosed in quotation
 .                                                                    

marks. Single words or phrases are usually printed in italics. Both
     .                                                       .     

italics and quotation marks should not be used except under certain
                                                                   

unusual conditions or when positively ordered by the author.
                                                           .




8. Quotation marks may be used with a word to which the writer desires
 .                                                                    

to attract particular attention or to which he desires to give an
                                                                 

unusual, technical, or ironical meaning.
       ,          ,                    .




    This "gentleman" needs a shave.
         "         "              .




9. When a quotation is long or when it is introduced in a formal manner,
 .                                                                     ,

it is usually preceded by a colon. Isolated words or phrases call for no
                                 .                                      

point after the introductory clause. This is true when the phrases so
                                   .                                 

quoted run to considerable length, provided there is no break in the
                                 ,                                  

flow of thought and expression.
                              .




10. When a quotation ends a sentence the quotation marks are placed
  .                                                                

after the period.
                .




The comma is always placed inside the quotation marks.
                                                     .




The position of the other marks (semicolon, colon, exclamation, and
                                (         ,      ,            ,    

interrogation) is determined by the sense. If they form a part of the
             )                           .                           

matter quoted, they go inside the quote marks; if not, they go outside
             ,                               ;       ,                

them.
    .




11. When quotation marks occur at the beginning of a line of poetry,
  .                                                                ,

they should go back into the indention space.
                                            .




    "Breathes there a man with soul so dead
    "                                      

     Who never to himself hath said,
                                   ,

      'This is my own, my native land'?"
      '              ,               '?"




This illustration is also a good example of the use of marks in
                                                               

combinations. We have first the single quotation marking the end of the
            .                                                          

included quotation, then the interrogation which ends the sentence, then
                  ,                                               ,     

the double quotation marks in their proper position.
                                                   .




Quotation marks should not be used needlessly. Very familiar expressions
                                             .                          

from the best known authors, such as _to the manor born_, _a conscience
                           ,                            ,              

void of offence_, _with malice toward none and charity for all_, have
                ,                                              ,     

become part of the current coin of speech and need not be quoted. Lists
                                                                .      

of words considered as words merely, lists of books or plays, and other
                                   ,                        ,          

such copy should be printed without quotation marks. Sprinkling a page
                                                   .                  

thickly with quotation marks not only spoils its appearance but makes it
                                                                        

hard to read, without adding to its clearness of meaning.

GENERAL REMARKS
               







Book titles are now set without points. This fashion was introduced by

Do not put a period before the apostrophe and the possessive _s_ as in

SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS
                                       




The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet, are
                       ,                                       ,    

intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as an aid
                  ( )                                    , ( )          

to the student in putting the information contained into definite
                                                                 

statements without actually memorizing the text, (3) as a means of
                                               , ( )              

securing from the student a reproduction of the information in his own
                                                                      

words.
     .




A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
                                                                   

acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental
                                        ,                        

omission of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed that
                                  .                                    

nothing should be omitted.
                         .




In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
                                                                      

and such others as may occur to the teacher should be made the basis of
                                                                       

frequent written work, and of final examinations.
                     ,                          .




The importance of written work cannot be overstated. It not only assures
                                                   .                    

knowledge of material, but the power to express that knowledge correctly

and in good form.
                .




If this written work can be submitted to the teacher in printed form it
                                                                       

will be doubly useful.
