PREFACE.


Timothy Dexter, the author of the following curious and unique production,
entitled "_A Pickle for the Knowing Ones_," which is here re-printed
verbatim et spellatim from the original edition, was born in Malden,
January 22, 1747. Having served an apprenticeship with a leather dresser,
he commenced business in Newburyport shortly after he was one and
twenty, and being industrious and economical, he soon found himself
in good circumstances. In the year 1770 he married, and receiving a
considerable amount of money with his wife, he was thus put in possession
of a moderate fortune. In 1776 he had for one of his apprentices the
no less eccentric, and afterwards the no less noted Jonathan Plumer,
jun., "travelling preacher, physician and poet," as he was accustomed
to style himself, and of whom we shall hereafter speak. In addition to
his regular business of selling leather breeches, gloves "soutabel for
wimen's ware," &c. he engaged in commercial speculations, and in various
kinds of business, and was unusually successful. He traded with merchants
and speculators in the then Province of Maine, was engaged to some extent
in the West India trade. He also purchased a large amount of what were
called State securities, which were eventually redeemed at prices far
exceeding their original cost. Some of his speculations in whalebone
and warming pans are mentioned by himself on page 23 of this work. Thus
in various ways he added to his property, and in a few years he became
a wealthy man. With wealth came the desire of distinction, and as his
vanity was inordinate he spared no expence in obtaining the notoriety he
sought. In the first place he purchased an elegant house in High Street,
Newburyport, and embellished it in his peculiar way. Minarets surmounted
with golden balls were placed on the roof, a large gilt eagle was placed
on the top, and a great variety of other ornaments. In front of his house
and land he caused to be erected between forty and fifty wooden statues,
full length and larger than life. The principal arch stood directly in
front of his door, and on this stood the figures of Washington, Adams
and Jefferson. There were also the statues of William Pitt, Franklin,
Bonaparte, George IV, Lord Nelson, Gen. Morgan, Cornplanter, an Indian
Chief, Jack Tar, Traveling Preacher, Maternal Affection, Two Grenadiers,
Four Lions and one Lamb, and conspicuous among them were two images of
Dexter himself, one of which held a label with the inscription "_I am the
first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher
in the Western world_." In order that the interior of his house should
correspond with the exterior, the most costly furniture was imported from
France, and the walls hung with paintings, brought from Holland and other
parts of Europe. A library was also provided, but how large or valuable
we are not able to say. An elegant coach with a span of beautiful cream
colored horses was procured, on which was painted his coat of arms,
with the baronial supporters, after the manner of the English nobility.
With this equipage he took the title of Lord Dexter, because, as he said,
it was "the voice of the people at Large." He was sometimes called
the Marquis of Newburyport. Having completed the embelishments of his
house and gardens, Lord Dexter busied himself in receiving the visits of
the crowds, who were drawn by curiosity to his house. His gardens were
thrown open to their inspection, and he was liberal to all. The fame of
his hospitality attracted as many visitors as the fame of his images. To
gratify his vanity he selected in imitation of European princes, a poet
laureate. This was no other than his former apprentice, Jonathan Plumer,
jun., a native of Newbury. They had once been associated as master and
apprentice, but now stood in the relation of patron and poet. From the
auto-biography of Plumer a very curious and scarce production of 244
pages, the following extract is taken, which may serve to give some idea
of the versatility of his genius.--"I had," says he, "some practice as
a physician, and earned something with my pen, but for several years
was obliged chiefly to follow various kinds of business accounted
less honorable, viz: Farming, repeating select passages from authors,
selling halibut, sawing wood, selling books and ballads in the streets,
serving as post boy, filling beds with straw and wheeling them to the
owners thereof, collecting rags, &c." He had previously served one or two
campaigns as a soldier, and on his return from the wars he taught school
for some time in New Hampshire. The ballads, which he hawked about, were
generally his own composition. Every horrid accident, bloody murder, a
shipwreck, or any other dreadful catastrophe, was sure to be followed by
a statement of the facts, a sermon and a poem. In the capacity of ballad
maker and monger he attracted the notice of Dexter, in whose service he
entered for a small salary as poet laureate. He wore a livery, consisting
of a black frock coat, adorned with stars and fringes, a cocked hat
and black breeches. He was crowned in the garden of his patron with a
wreath of parsley, instead of laurel, but the ceremony was interrupted
before its completion by a mob of boys, and both patron and poet put to
flight. One specimen of his laudatory verses may be seen on page 29 of
this work, which will give the reader some idea of his qualifications
for the office to which he was elected. How well he was satisfied with
the praises of the poet we are not informed, but feeling probably that
no person but himself could do justice to the ideas, which he wished
to present to the public, he commenced writing for the press. Several
of these effusions were printed in the newspapers.--The larger part
of them written at different times are embodied in the present work, a
large edition of which was published by himself and given away. In this
edition not a stop or a mark was used in any line of his writings, but
in the second edition one entire page was filled with stops and marks,
with a recommendation from the author to his readers, to use them where
they were wanted in the work, or in his own language, "to peper and
soolt it as they pleased." Dexter had two children, Samuel and Nancy,
neither of whom was distinguished for strength of intellect. The son was
a dissipated prodigal and died young. The daughter, of whom mention is
made by the father in the following pages, was married to Abraham Bishop
of New Haven, who we are informed treated her with neglect and cruelty.
A divorce followed and she became intemperate, lost what little reason
she had, and is still living, a wretched object. Lord Dexter himself,
if we may judge from his own writings and from what we have heard, was
not happy in his domestic relations. He complains much of his wife,
whom he calls the "gost," and charges the cause of his separation
from her for thirteen years to his son Bishop. His own temper was
irascible, and several stories are told of the excesses, into which
it would sometimes lead him. He ordered his painter, Mr. Babson, to
place the word "Constitution" on the scroll in the hand of the figure of
Jefferson, which the latter, knowing the artist designed it to represent
the Declaration of Independence, refused to do. Dexter was so incensed
by this refusal, that he went into the house, and brought out a pistol,
which he deliberately fired at the painter; but he was a poor shot, and
the ball missing its object, entered the side of the house. At another
time, seeing a countryman, as he thought, rather impudently viewing his
premises, he ordered his son to fire at the stranger. He refused to do so,
when the father threatened to shoot him unless he complied. His son then
obeyed. The stranger escaped unhurt, but entered a complaint, and Lord
Timothy was, in consequence, sentenced to the house of correction for
several months. He went thither in his own coach, priding himself
on being the first man who had been to the county house in his own
carriage, drawn by two splendid horses. He soon grew tired, however, of
his confinement, and procured a release, which it was said, cost him a
thousand dollars. The individual, who exercised most influence over Dexter
was a negro woman, named Lucy Lancaster, or as she was commonly called
"Black Luce," a woman of uncommon strength of mind, great shrewdness
and remarkable for her powers of memory and knowledge of human nature,
but as wicked as she was sagacious. She thought him an honest man, and
not so deficient in intellect as many people supposed, and attributed
his eccentricities to an excess of animal spirits.--This was probably to
some extent true, though it is certain that other spirits contributed in
no small degree to the excesses of his temper and the peculiarities of
his taste. He was addicted to drunkenness, and with his son and other
companions, kept up his revels in the best apartments of his house,
by which in a very short time, all his costly furniture was ruined,
or very much injured.

"Not insensible that he must share the common lot, Dexter, many years
before his death, prepared himself a tomb. It was the basement story of
his summer-house, magnificently fitted, and open to the light of day. His
coffin, made of the best mahogany which he could find, superbly lined,
and adorned with silver handles, he kept in a room of the house, and
took great pleasure in exhibiting it to visitors--at other times it was
locked up. Soon after his death apparatus was prepared, Dexter got up a
mock funeral, which with all but his family and a few associates was to
pass as real. Various people in the town were invited by card, who came
and found the family clad in mourning, and preparations for the funeral
going forward. The burial service was read by a wag, who then pronounced
a bombastic eulogy upon the deceased. The mourners moved in procession to
the tomb in the garden, the coffin was deposited, and they returned to
the large hall, where a sumptuous entertainment was provided. While the
feast was going on, a loud noise attracted the guests to the kitchen,
where they beheld the arisen Lord caning his wife for not having shed
a tear during the ceremony! He entered the hall with the astonished
mourners, in high spirits, joined in the rout, threw money from the
window to the crowd of boys, and expressed his satisfaction with every
thing except the indifference of his wife, and the silence of the bells."

Lord Dexter died at his house, on the 26th of October, 1806, in his 60th
year, and by direction of the Board of Health, his remains were interred
in the common burying place. His grave is marked by a simple stone.

The Dexter mansion, is yet standing, and is a very fine tenement, but
retains few traces of the whims of its late proprietor. Of the images,
upwards of forty in number, only the three Presidents now remain, the
others having been cast down by the resistless hand of time. Some of
them were blown down in the great gale of September, 1815, and were sold
at auction.

The cut fronting the Biography gives a very excellent and faithful
representation of Lord Dexter in his walking habits, and the likeness of
the dog is equally perfect. The dog was perfectly black and the skin as
entirely free from hair as that of an elephant. He differed as much from
other dogs as did his master and his friend, the poet, differ from other
people. The likenesses of all three were drawn with great accuracy by
James Aiken, Esq. now a resident of Philadelphia, and could the patron
and the poet be seen in proper person, dressed in the costume of that
day, they would be objects of great curiosity. But they are gone, and
of each it may be truly said,


  We ne'er shall look upon his like again.

For the Impartial Herald.

_Messrs. Blunt & March_,

I say to whom it may concern--to the majesty of the people of Newburyport,
Greeting--

It costs Eight hundred Dollars a year to support a watch in this town, and
yer gentlemen's windows are broken, fences pulled down and Cellars broken
open, and much other misdemeanors done at night. Are the watch asleep, or
are they afraid to detect those who are guilty of such practises? Boast
not of it if you call this Liberty and Equality. Newburyport has had
the name of being a very civil worthy place; it is a great pity some bad
boys or young men should disgrace it. I hope our worthy and honorable
rulers will bring those rude lads to see themselves and lick the dust
like serpents, and ask forgiveness of their betters, and do so no more,
but repent and live.

Now fellow citizens is it wisdom, is it policy, to use a man or men so
shocking bad as to oblige them to leave the town where they paid one
Dollar a day to support government?

A friend to good order, honor to whom it belongs--to great men a
friend--to all good citizens and honest men good bye.

       *       *       *       *       *


Whereas many philosophers has judged or guessed at many things about
this world, and so on. Now I suppose I may guess, as it is guessing
times. I guess the world is one very large living creature, and always
was, and always will be without any end from everlasting to everlasting,
and no end. What grows on this large creature is trees and many other
things. In the room of hair the rocks is moulds. This is called land
where the hair grows, the belly the sea--all kinds of fish is the worms
in the belly. This large body wants dressing to get our living of this
creature and by industry we get a living--we and all the animal creation
is less than fleas in comparison on the back or belly of this very large
immense body. Among the hairs to work this great body is that of nature,
past finding out.--All we know is we are here, we come into the world
crying and go out groaning. Mankind is the master beast on the earth--in
the sea, the whale is the head fish--the minim is the smallest fish--the
great fish eat up the little ones, and so not only destroy one another,
but they are master over the whole of beasts and fish, even over a lion,
therefore man is the masterly beast and the worst of the whole--they know
the most, and act the worst according to what they know. Seeing mankind so
bad by nature, I think when the candle goes out, men and women is done,
they will lay as dirt or rocks till the great gun fires, and when that
goes off the gun will be so large that the gun will contain nine hundred
million tons of the best of good powder, then that will shake and bring
all the bones together, then the world will be to an end. All kinds of
music will be going on, funding systems will be laid aside, the melody
will be very great. Now why cant you all believe the above written as
well as many other things to be true; as well as what was set forth in
the last Centinel concerning digging up a frog twenty five feet below
the surface, where it was most as hard as a rock--there was his shape
like taking a stone out of a rock--This is from a minister. Now why wont
you believe me as well.

       *       *       *       *       *


WONDER OF WONDERS!

How great the soul is! Do not you all wonder & admire to see and behold
and hear? Can you all believe half the truth, and admire to hear the
wonders how great the soul is--only behold--past finding out! Only see
how large the soul is!--that if a man is drowned in the sea, what a
great bubble comes up out of the top of the water! the last of the man
dying under water--this is wind--is the soul that is the last to ascend
out of the deep to glory--it is the breath from on high doth go on high
to glory. The bubble is the soul. A young fellow's for gunning for the
good of bodies and souls.

APPENDIX.

IN HONOR OF

TIMOTHY DEXTER, ESQ.


This great philosopher may indeed be styled a phenomenon in nature! The
many literary qualifications he possesses rank him foremost among literary
characters.----That unequalled production from the pen of this wonderful
philosopher, denominated "_A Pickle for the Knowing Ones_," has not only
received universal applause, and been ranked as of the first magnitude
in the literary world, but has had such rapidity in its sale, that a
copy cannot be procured, though diligently sought after by men of the
most transcendant merit.

Where can we find a man so extensively useful, and so eminently
calculated to diffuse light to a dark and ignorant multitude, as this
rare philosopher? How penetrating his understanding! How deep his
ideas! What a multitude of discoveries which before were hid in embryo,
have made their appearance at the nod of his genius! Surely we may say,
Blessed are the people who are highly favored with the greatest Luminary
that ever gave light to an existing world!!

While aiming at a just portrait of this remarkable Naturalist and
Philosopher, his generosity is no less a subject of admiration, than
his literary and philosophical abilities. The readiness with which his
benevolent soul bestows donations calls forth the grateful acknowledgement
of all who have been liberally assisted from his bountiful hand.

See him the first to assist in building a church for the worship of
God! See him liberally give for the purchase of bells, the ready cash,
without hesitation! See him expending his fortune to preserve in
everlasting romembrance, characters who have shone with unexampled
greatness in Europe and America! Here the subject fails. Vain man may
as well attempt to stop the course of nature, as to do ample justice to
this wonderful man!


  Behold all nature stands aghast
  To hear thy fame from east to west!
  How great how grand of thee we hear,
  Thou man of sense--thou eastern star!

  All men inquire--but few can tell
  How thou in science doth excel!
  Great philosophic genius, we,
  The meanest reptiles, bow the knee.

  At thy majestic shrine we shrink!
  What can we do, or say, or think!
  When contemplating on thy worth.
  Which hath astonish'd all the earth.

  Great DEXTER, did the world do right,
  Thy name would shine with brilliant light!
  Each would declare thy wond'rous fame,
  And shout at DEXTER'S mighty name!

                                                  SALEM, _June 14, 1805_

MY LORD DEXTER,

By the politeness of Mr. _Emerson_ I received the very valuable contents
of your package. A new edition of that unprecedented performance, entitled
"A Pickle for the Knowing Ones," &c. is very urgently called for by the
friends of literature in this country and in England--and I presume with
the additions and improvements intended to accompany the second edition,
provided it should be well printed, would entitle the author to a seat
with the Disciples of Sir Joseph Banks, if not to a place in Bonaparte's
Legion of Honor--for my Lord DEXTER is an honorable man. But, sir, the
work cannot be executed for the sum named--nor in the time specified.--I
will print an edition of 500 copies with the additions, for fifty dollars,
and cannot possibly do them for less.

Wishing your Lordship health in perpetuity--a continuance of your
admirable reasoning faculties--good _spirits_, and an abundance of
wealth--and finally a safe passage over any river not with _Sticks_,
but a pleasure boat, I remain yours with the utmost profundity.

                                                             W. CARLTON.

    _Kt. Newburyport_.               }

MR. MELCHER,

    _Your publishing the following extract from a letter said to be
    from a trader among the Indians to a friend, may amuse some of
    your customers for the Gazette._

A few days ago one of the Indians paid me a visit. After some
conversation, he said that a minister from the United States had been with
his tribe to teach them the Christian religion. He says that there is but
one only living and true God, who is a good, wise, and powerful spirit
(this Indian say too) and that there are three persons in the god head,
of one substance and power, God the father, God the Son and God the Holy
Ghost, that the Father is of none, neither begotten, or proceeding,
the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, the Holy Ghost eternally
proceeding from the Father and the Son, and that the Holy Ghost visited
a virgin, and conveyed the Son into her; where he continued nine moons
and then was born like other children, was born God and man, that when
he was about thirty years old began to preach, but the great men no like
his preaching, sent their warriors, who took and killed him.

Indians ask what all this talk mean, he say that the first man and woman
broke God's law in eating what God had forbidden, that therefore they and
all the children that should proceed from them must die, and be punished
after death forever; that the Son came and died to save some of mankind
from being punished after death. Oh! 'trange that man could kill God
the Son, and that his death be of service to mankind--great many people
die before the Son of God, and did not know any thing about him--it was
then asked whether his dying would do poor Indians any good; he say yes,
if they believe; then me say that pappoose no believe them do no good;
he say you must leave that with God, and believe for yourself--one say
it is hard to believe such 'tories; if Indian tell such 'trange things,
the white people no believe um.


    _A curious Sermon, by the Rev. Mr. Hyberdin, which he made at
    the request of certain thieves that robbed him on a hill near
    Hartlgrow, in Hampshire, (England) in their presence and at
    that instant._

I greatly marvel that any man will disgrace thieving, and think that
the doers thereof are worthy of death, considering it as a thing that
cometh near unto virtue, being used in all countries, and allowed by
God himself; the thing which I cannot compendiously show unto you at so
short a warning, and on so sharp an occasion. I must desire you, gentle
audience of thieves, to take in good part what at this time cometh into
my mind, not doubting but that you, through your good knowledge, are
able to add much more unto it, than this which I shall now offer unto you.

First, Fortitude and stoutness of courage, and also boldness of mind,
is commended of some men to be a virtue; which being granted, who is
there then that will not judge thieves to be virtuous? For they are of
all men the most stout and hardy, and the most void of fear; for thieving
is a thing usual among all men; for not only you that are here present,
but also many others in divers places, both men, women and children, rich
and poor, are daily of the faculty, as the hangman at Newgate can testify;
and that it is allowed of by God himself is evident from Scripture; For
if you examine the whole course of the Bible you will find that thieves
have been beloved of God; for Jacob, when he came out of Mesopotamia,
did steal his uncle Laban's kids. The same Jacob did also steal his
brother Esau's blessing; and yet God said, _I have chosen Jacob and
refused Esau_. The children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,
did steal the Egyptian's jewels of silver and jewels of gold, as God
commanded them to do.

David, in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, came into the temple and
stole the hallowed bread; and yet God said, "David is a man after my own
heart." Christ himself, when he was here on earth, did take an ass and
colt that was none of his; and yet God said, "This is my beloved son,
in whom I am well pleased." _Thus you see that God delighted in thieves._

But most of all I marvel that men can despise thieves, whereas in many
points you be like Christ himself; for Christ had no dwelling place no
more than you--Christ at length was caught, and so will you--he went to
hell and so will you. In this you differ from him, for he rose and went
into heaven--so you will never do without God's great mercy, which God
grant you. To whom with the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, be all honor
and glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.

MARQUIS OF NEWBURYPORT!!


    [_On Monday last arrived in this town the most noble and
    illustrious Lord TIMOTHY DEXTER, of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
    who has since his arrival requested the publication of the
    following stanzas in this day's paper, as a humble tribute to
    the incomprehensible majesty of his name! While they serve as a
    brilliant specimen of the gifted talents and admirable sublimity
    of the Laureat, from whose pen they flowed, the virtuoso in
    genealogies, and the worshippers of noble rank and boundless
    fortune may derive a rich and delicious satisfaction from the
    subject to which they are devoted!_

       *       *       *       *       *


ADVERTISEMENT EXTRA.

OF THE CELEBRATED

LORD DEXTER.


  LORD DEXTER is a man of fame,
  Most celebrated is his name;
  More precious far than gold that's pure,
  Lord Dexter live for evermore.

  His noble house it shines more bright
  Than Lebanon's most pleasant height,
  Never was one who step'd therein
  Who wanted to come out again.

  His house is fill'd with sweet perfumes,
  Rich furniture doth fill his rooms;
  Inside and out it is adorn'd,
  And on the top an eagle's form'd.

  His house is white and trimm'd with green,
  For many miles it may be seen;
  It shines as bright as any star,
  The fame of it has spread afar.

  Lord Dexter, thou, whose name alone
  Shines brighter than king George's throne;
  Thy name shall stand in books of fame,
  And Princes shall his name proclaim.

  Lord Dexter hath a coach beside,
  In pomp and splendor he doth ride;
  The horses champ the silver bitt,
  And throw the foam around their feet.

  The images around him stand,
  For they were made by his command;
  Looking to see Lord Dexter come,
  With fixed eyes they see him home.

  Four lions stand to guard the door,
  With their mouths open to devour
  All enemies who do disturb
  Lord Dexter or his shady grove.

  Lord Dexter, like king Solomon,
  Hath gold and silver by the ton,
  And bells to churches he hath given,
  To worship the great king of heaven.

  His mighty deeds they are so great,
  He's honor'd both by church and state,
  And when he comes all must give way,
  To let Lord Dexter bear the sway.

  When Dexter dies all things shall droop,
  Lord East, Lord West, Lord North shall stoop,
  And then Lord South with pomp shall come,
  And bear his body to the tomb.

  His tomb most charming to behold,
  A thousand sweets it doth unfold;
  When Dexter dies shall willows weep,
  And mourning friends shall fill the street.

  May Washington immortal stand,
  May Jefferson by God's command
  Support the right of all mankind,
  John Adams not a whit behind.

  America with all your host,
  Lord Dexter in a bumper toast;
  May he enjoy his life in peace,
  And when he's dead his name not cease.

  In heaven may he always reign,
  For there's no sorrow, sin, nor pain:
  Unto the world I leave the rest,
  For to pronounce Lord Dexter blest.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
