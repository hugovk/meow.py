PREFACE
       







The first edition of this work was published in 1896, and the treatment
                                                    ,                  

of the subject was so highly commended by many leading men and
                                                              

periodicals of the country that the entire edition, though a large one,
                                                  ,                   ,

was soon exhausted. In spite of this favorable commendation, which may
                  .                                        ,          

have been due to my effort to set forth reasons, instead of rules,
                                               ,                 ,

for the use of marks, I had a keen sense of certain shortcomings in
                    ,                                              

the work, and have long been unwilling to permit its reprinting or
        ,                                                         

to undertake its rewriting. At least one of the reasons—and I hope
                          .                            —          

the principal one—why the work fell short of my ideal of the book
                 —                                               

needed, was the inevitable failure inherent in the mode of treating the
      ,                                                                

subject. As a sentence may contain the four principal marks (comma,
       .                                                    (     ,

semicolon, colon, and period) and, in addition, one or more of the
         ,      ,           )    ,            ,                   

other marks, a writer courts failure if, in treating the difficult
           ,                           ,                          

art of punctuation, he deals with the marks separately, beginning, as
                  ,                                   ,          ,   

all writers, myself included, have hitherto done, with the comma, the
           ,                ,                   ,               ,    

most difficult mark to understand, and proceeding, one at a time, with
                                 ,               ,              ,     

the other marks. Failure follows this mode of treatment because it
               .                                                  

disregards the interrelation of marks and the relations between groups
                                                                      

of words to be interpreted by marks.
                                   .




In this edition, which has been entirely rewritten, I have endeavored
               ,                                  ,                  

to avoid the fault of such mode of treatment, and have dealt, from
                                            ,               ,     

the outset, with groups of interrelated marks, exhibiting, for
          ,                                  ,           ,    

instance, in a single illustrative sentence (No. 6) the four principal
        ,                                   (  .  )                   

marks in their interrelation as affected by the sense relations of
                                                                  

the language of the sentence. I believe that this treatment of the
                            .                                     

subject of punctuation is the only logical one; and because of the
                                              ;                   

lack of a logical treatment of the subject it is no exaggeration to
                                                                   

say that almost utter chaos as regards punctuation which is helpful
                                                                   

to both reader and writer, exists everywhere, inside and outside of

In the preface of the first edition I said it was a remarkable fact
                                                                   

that the subject of punctuation had been very inadequately treated,
                                                                  ,

as evidenced by the existence at that time of only a single treatise
                                                                    

on punctuation in the English language, and by the total absence of
                                      ,                            

any consideration of it in periodical literature. This assertion,
                                                .               ,

with slight modification, is true today. An admirable essay by Mr.

the interchangeability of marks, only confounds the confusion of

understanding of the principles which do underlie the convention that
                                                                     

makes punctuation correct or faulty. One of his illustrative examples
                                   .                                 

exhibiting the interchangeability of three marks, is discussed herein;

and an effort is made to discover the “principles” that determine the
                                      “          ”                   

correct punctuation of the example, and to show that the marks used by
                                  ,

INTRODUCTION
            







I hope my appreciation of the difficulties which beset the student and

method in the study of the subject with this book as a guide.
                                                            .




Until one has gained almost complete mastery of the meanings of
                                                               

marks and of the subtle sense relations between the groups of words
                                                                   

constituting language, he cannot interpret such relations when
                     ,

the student is not to give extended consideration to points discussed
                                                                     

herein which are not readily comprehended by him, but to gain mastery
                                                ,                    

of the reasons for the use of marks which indicate language relations

unlike the principles of mathematics, are not regularly progressive

attempt to master consecutively such principles. Let him, rather, read

sentences whose punctuation presents principles which, though new to
                                                     ,

   ,                  .            ,                                   

the marked sentences, will, I am sure, give him a comprehension of the

punctuation based upon reason.
                             .




Having in this way gained a fairly complete knowledge of the fine use
                                                                     

of marks, that is, of _close_ punctuation, he will naturally begin
        ,        ,                       ,                        

so to frame his own written language that many marks may safely be
                                                                  

omitted, thus gaining mastery of an _open_ punctuation that will not

CHAPTER I
         




THE FUNCTIONS OF MARKS, AND HOW PERFORMED
                      ,                  







A mark of punctuation is used because it has a meaning, and serves a
                                                      ,             

useful, if not an indispensable, purpose in printed language.[1] In
      ,                        ,                            .[ ]   

order to serve such purpose, the meaning of the mark must be thoroughly
                           ,                                           

understood by both the writer and the reader.
                                            .




The function of marks is twofold:
                                :




1. To reveal the _real_ meaning of printed language.
 .                                                 .




2. To reveal such meaning _at a glance_.
 .                                     .




Marks perform this function in three ways:
                                         :




1. By breaking up apparent groups of words, which readily form
 .                                        ,                   

themselves into new groups.
                          .




2. By showing the relations between groups.
 .                                        .




3. By characterizing a group of words.
 .                                   .




Language, both printed and spoken, conveys meaning, not only by the
        ,                        ,                ,                

meanings of the words constituting such language, but by the meanings
                                                ,                    

of the relations between the words, used singly or in groups. In spoken
                                  ,                         .          

language these relations are indicated, at least to a considerable
                                      ,                           

extent, by pauses and by inflections of the voice; in printed language,
      ,                                          ;                    ,

however, we are compelled to use punctuation to indicate them. As
       ,                                                     .   

spoken language is generally quite different from written language,
                                                                  ,

marks of punctuation do not always indicate voice-inflections; but, as
                                                 -           ;    ,   

both marks and inflections express the sense relations between groups
                                                                     

of words, they are not infrequently suggestive of each other. For
        ,                                                   .    

instance, each of the three end-marks groups words into a sentence, and
        ,                      -                                  ,    

tells what kind of a sentence it follows. Let us illustrate this in a
                                        .                            

dialogue between a teacher and a pupil:
                                      :




  _Pupil._ John has gone home.
        .                    .




  _Teacher._ John has gone home? [or]
          .                    ? [  ]




  _Teacher._ John has gone home!
          .                    !




We call the first sentence a _declarative_ sentence because it
                                                              

makes a declaration. We call the second, regardless of its form, an
                   .                   ,                       ,   

_interrogative_ sentence because it asks a question (interrogates). We
                                                    (            ).   

call the third an _exclamatory_ sentence because it expresses surprise
                                                                      

(exclamation).
(           ).




In the oral conversation between the teacher and the pupil the voice
                                                                    

would readily indicate the meaning of each sentence; but on the printed
                                                   ;                   

page marks of punctuation are necessary to convey the meaning. Thus
                                                             .     

each mark in these sentences _characterizes_ the kind of sentence it

       ,                                                    .




The meanings of these three marks are so plain that they give little
                                                                    

trouble to any reader, even the youngest. Most of the marks that fall
                     ,                  .                            

within the sentence should convey meanings quite as plainly and quite
                                                                     

as readily as do these three end-marks. It is the purpose of our
                                -     .                         

study that they be made to do so, for they are quite as useful as the
                                ,                                    

end-marks.
   -     .




Marks are used intelligently only when each mark can give an
                                                            

intelligent answer to the reader who, meeting it on the printed page,
                                    ,                               ,

challenges it with “What do you say to me?” This challenge may be made
                   “                     ?”                           

the supreme test of the value of any mark of punctuation.
                                                        .







The function of marks can best be shown by a study of their uses in
                                                                   

illustrative examples:[2]
                     :[ ]




  1. Respect the rights of children and their mothers will respect you.
   .                                                                  .




No mark is required in this sentence to reveal its real meaning, for
                                                               ,    

that is unmistakable; but almost any reader will momentarily mistake
                    ;                                               

the meaning at the point where it seems to read as if written “the
                                                              “   

rights of children and _of_ their mothers.” When the reader discovers
                                         .”                          

that “the rights of their mothers” are not referred to, he is like a
     “                           ”                    ,             

traveler who has taken the wrong road, and, discovering his mistake,
                                     ,    ,                        ,

must retrace his steps.
                      .




If a mistake has been made in reading this sentence, the reader must go
                                                   ,                   

back to the point where the mistake was made, and regroup the words.
                                            ,                      .

The process of regrouping the parts of a sentence is both distracting
                                                                     

and tiresome when reading silently, and is very awkward when reading
                                  ,                                 

aloud.
     .




The mistake is a mistake in grouping, that is in making one group of
                                    ,                               

the words “children and their mothers” when these words are not so
          “                          ”                            

grouped by the meaning of the language.
                                      .




We call “and” a _conjunction_, that is, a _grouping_ word. It naturally
        “   ”                ,        ,                  .             

groups together the two words between which it stands, especially if
                                                     ,              

they make sense when so grouped. If these words are not to be thus
                               .                                  

grouped, the reader will be helped by having notice to this effect at
       ,                                                             

the point where a wrong grouping may be made. We place a sign-board to
                                            .                -        

guide a traveler; and one is equally useful to guide a reader. A mark
                ;                                            .       

of punctuation is the reader’s sign-board; and it is _to be read_ for
                            ’      -     ;                           

its _directions_.
                .







As we cannot well discuss at this point in our study the proper mark
                                                                    

to use in Sentence 1 we may select the comma, leaving the reason for
                                            ,                       

the selection to be considered later. Thus the sentence written with a
                                    .                                 

sign-board, is as follows:
    -     ,              :




  1-1.[3] Respect the rights of children, and their mothers will
   - .[ ]                               ,                       

  respect you.
             .




The answer to the challenge, “What do you mean?” put by the reader to
                           , “                ?”                     

the comma in this sentence, would be somewhat like this: “Reader, ‘and’
                          ,                            : “      , ‘   ’

is not to be followed by a word with the same relation to ‘of’ that
                                                          ‘  ’     

‘children’ sustains to ‘of.’” In other words, “and” does not form the
‘        ’             ‘  .’”               , “   ”                  

very simple group of words that it appears to form without the comma:
                                                                    :

it forms a new group.
                    .




With this notice, the first group is quite automatically formed by the
                ,                                                     

reader; for the meaning of the language up to this point has been fully
      ;                                                                

comprehended, and is not to be supplemented by any word in the _and_
            ,                                                       

relation to “children.”
            “        .”







In a sentence as simple in its grouping as No. 1, the liability
                                             .  ,              

to error is not very great, especially for one who has read much;
                          ,                                     ;

nor is the readjustment of the thought, in case such a reader has
                                      ,                          

made a mistake, very difficult for him. In more complex sentences,
              ,                       .                          ,

the confusion of ideas becomes more marked, and more difficult of
                                          ,                      

readjustment even by the experienced reader:
                                           :




  2.... Far beyond this group of beautiful hills fell gradually to the
   ....                                                               

  plain.
       .




The words in the first line of this sentence, as above printed, group
                                            ,                 ,      

themselves together in a natural manner, forming a definite picture;
                                       ,                           ;

but, when the reader reaches the first word in the second line, he
   ,                                                          ,   

discovers that a subject must be found for “fell,” for he has made a
                                           “    ,”                  

wrong grouping. It is probable that most readers would read to the end
              .                                                       

of the sentence in search of a clue to the proper grouping, then turn
                                                          ,          

back to the beginning, and regroup the words after a careful study
                     ,                                            

of their relations. Although the sense is thus easily obtained, the
                  .                                           ,    

process of regrouping is distracting.
                                    .




The trouble arises from the fact that the words in the first line
                                                                 

naturally fall into a group which makes good sense, but not the sense
                                                  ,                  

intended by the writer. A mark (sign-board) is needed to show the
                      .        (    -     )                      

reader that the _natural_ grouping is not the correct grouping. We mean
                                                              .        

by the “natural” grouping that grouping which arises from reading the
       “       ”                                                     

words in the usual way, thus making “this group of beautiful hills”
                      ,             “                             ”

the object of “beyond.” In other words, the _natural_ meaning is the
              “      .”               ,                             

_apparent_ meaning.
                  .




When the _apparent_ meaning is not the _real_ meaning, the reader is
                                                     ,              

momentarily misled,—that is, he gets off the real line of thought, just
                  ,—       ,                                     ,     

as a traveler gets off the right road.
                                     .




With a sign-board the sentence will read as follows:
           -                                       :




  2-1. Far beyond, this group of beautiful hills fell gradually to the
   - .           ,                                                    

  plain.
       .




In this detached sentence we do not know the object of “beyond.” It
                                                       “      .”   

would, however, be furnished by what preceded it in the context; and
     ,        ,                                                ;    

yet the liability to error in reading the complete, unpunctuated
                                                  ,             

sentence would still exist. Let us supply the context:
                          .                          :




  2-2. In the morning we saw in the east a group of hills, the crest
   - .                                                   ,          

  of which we reached at noonday. Far beyond, this group of beautiful
                                .           ,                        

  hills fell gradually to the plain.
                                   .




The context furnishes the object of “beyond,” which is “the crest.”
                                    “      ,”          “         .”







REAL AND APPARENT MEANINGS
                          




Let us examine somewhat more carefully the meanings of “real” and
                                                       “    ”    

“apparent,” terms which we have used, and shall continue to use, in our
“        ,”                         ,                          ,       

study.
     .




The _real_ meaning of any group of words is the meaning it
                                                          

unquestionably conveys to the intelligent reader after careful
                                                              

examination, if such an examination be required by its complexity. It
           ,                                                     .   

is also the meaning the writer presumably desires to convey.
                                                           .




The _apparent_ meaning of such group of words is the meaning it conveys
                                                                       

when read at sight.
                  .




The apparent meaning should always be the real meaning. If it is not,
                                                      .             ,

the language needs either recasting or regrouping. Recasting is done by
                                                 .                     

changing the positions of words or by the use of new words. Regrouping
                                                          .           

is done by the use of marks of punctuation, which thus perform their
                                          ,                         

functions. Each of the three end-marks also determines the character of
         .                      -                                      

the group it follows, as we have already seen.
                    ,                        .




In Sentences 1 and 2 we obtained the apparent, and _wrong_, meaning
                                             ,            ,        

at the first reading; and we obtained the real (right) meaning at the
                    ;                          (     )               

second reading. Marks, understood by the writer and the reader, give
              .      ,                                        ,     

the reader the real meaning at the first reading, at least when the
                                                ,                  

marks are used properly.
                       .




In each of Sentences 1-1 and 2-1 the mark of punctuation was used to
                      -       -                                     

_disconnect_ words apparently connected. In Sentence 1-1 the apparent
                                       .              -              

connection was made by a conjunction (and); in Sentence 2-1 it was made
                                     (   );              -             

by a preposition (beyond). Thus, in each corrected sentence, the comma
                 (      ).     ,                           ,          

performed the office of _disjunction_; and therefore the comma might
                                     ;                              

be called a _disjunctive_. When the reader thus disconnects words he
                         .                                          

regroups them, and learns, quite automatically, the proper relation
             ,           ,                    ,                    

between the new groups.
                      .




Let us note carefully that we are not dealing with difficult or obscure
                                                                       

processes, but with processes familiar to the ordinary reader, and
         ,                                                   ,    

equally familiar to the speaker, this grouping being done in speaking,
                               ,                                     ,

as already stated, by inflections of the voice and by pauses, which are
                 ,                                          ,          

understood by very young readers.
                                .




The relations between words and groups of words are expressed in terms
                                                                      

of grammar; but we shall avoid in our discussion, as far as possible,
          ;                                     ,                   ,

the use of technical terms.
                          .







In our next sentence no change in grouping is necessary unless we want
                                                                      

to make a complete change in the meaning of the language:
                                                        :




  3. The prisoner said the witness was a convicted thief.
   .                                                    .




The apparent meaning of this sentence is its real meaning, for its
                                                         ,        

language is capable of only one construction. If, however, the
                                            .   ,        ,    

writer of the sentence wished to convey another meaning, he could
                                                       ,         

have done so by recasting the sentence or by regrouping it by means
                                                                   

of marks of punctuation. If we put a comma after “prisoner” we
                       .                         “        ”   

disconnect “prisoner” from “said”; and the comma gives notice to the
           “        ”      “    ”;                                  

reader that new relations for the words “prisoner” and “said” must
                                        “        ”     “    ”     

be sought. The only other _sense_ relations for the words are found
         .                                                         

quite automatically the moment the eye catches the next two words,
                                                                 ,

which suggest to the reader a new group. When the new group (said the
                                       .                    (        

witness) is complete, the reader automatically cuts it off from what
       )            ,                                               

follows and what precedes. Thus we have, as shown in the following
                         .             ,                          

sentence, a new grouping and a new meaning:
        ,                                 :

The meaning of voice-changes is understood by children long before the

In spoken language the meaning of No. 3 is expressed by a continuous

The reading of No. 3-1, in order to convey its meaning to another

An analysis of one’s process of reading silently, that is, to himself,
                  ’                             ,        ,           ,

will show that, in reading No. 3-1, he takes note of the commas and
              ,              .  - ,                                

their meanings (disconnecting and regrouping), just as he takes note,
               (                            ),                      ,

when reading aloud, of the group depressed (written in a line below) in
                  ,                        (                       )   

No. 3-2.
  .  - .




To obtain the real meaning of this sentence when reading silently, he
                                                                 ,   

reads it _commatically_; to impart the meaning when reading aloud, he
                       ;                                         ,   

reads it _inflectionally_.
                         .







Our next illustrative sentence and its variations are not much unlike

words in them are not quite so familiar to young readers:

  4. Boys like Henry never fail in school.
   .                                     .




The meaning of this sentence is unmistakable, and at no point within
                                            ,

                                          ;                          

sentence doubt as to the meaning may arise:
                                          :




  4-1. Boys like men may be courageous for principle’s sake.

“Like Henry” in No. 4 suggests some distinguishing quality that Henry
“          ”      .                                                  

is known to possess,—for instance, _diligence_. Then, “boys like
                   ,—            ,            .     , “         

Henry” means “diligent boys.” But “like men” suggests no particular
     ”       “             .”     “        ”                       

qualities ascribed to boys; and therefore, if the term “like men” is
                          ;              ,             “        ”   

not applicable to or intended for “boys,” we cut it off by commas. Thus
                                  “    ,”                        .     

an _apparent_ relation is shown not to be the _real_ relation; and
                                                             ;    

therefore we must regroup the words, seeking the new meaning through
                                   ,                                

our knowledge of the meaning of language thus regrouped. The regrouped
                                                       .              

sentence will read as follows:
                             :




  4-2. Boys, like men, may be courageous for principle’s sake.
   - .     ,         ,                                ’      .




Regrouping of this kind cannot be automatically made by a writer, or
                                                                ,   

automatically apprehended by a reader, until the meanings of both the

unpunctuated and the punctuated language are perfectly familiar to
                                                                  

the writer or the reader. One’s familiarity with language need not

be purely technical to make it accurate and thorough; but we cannot
                                                    ;              

readily discuss the language of our illustrative sentences without
                                                                  

using some technical (grammatical) terms.
                     (           )      .




“Like men” in No. 4-1 is an adjective, and is in the natural position
“        ”      .  -                 ,                               

of an adjective of this kind. “Like men” in No. 4-2 is an adverb, and
                            . “        ”      .  -              ,    

is out of its natural position, thus readily giving rise to a wrong
                              ,                                    

grouping of the words in the sentence. To prevent such wrong grouping,

commas are used; and they will be used by a writer quite automatically
               ;                                                      

when the purpose and effect of such use are understood.
                                                      .




The use of most of the marks of punctuation should become as automatic
                                                                      

as is the spelling of most words; but some parts of each art become
                                ;

seems worthy of notice at this point in our discussion. To spell the

technicalities of punctuation have made the art so difficult that it
                                                                    

may be said to be almost a lost art. We are attempting to rediscover it
                                   .

Let the reader challenge the first comma, when he reaches it, in

No. 4-2 with “What do you say?” The answer will be, “Reader, if you

think ‘like men’ is an adjective describing ‘boys,’ as ‘like Henry’

          ‘    ’      .  ,                 ,                      

another meaning.” A like challenge of the second comma, if necessary,

will elicit this answer: “Reader, if you think ‘men’ is the subject of
                       : “      ,              ‘   ’                  

‘may,’ you are mistaken, and you must look for another meaning.”
‘   ,’                 ,                                      .”




That the use of the commas in No. 4-2 is practically the same as their
                                .  -

         .  - ,                                         :




  4-3. Boys        may be courageous for principle’s sake.
   - .                                            ’      .

           like men
                   




There is another and very important class of words whose sense relation
                                                                       

is determined by the punctuation we have been considering. We shall
                                                         .         

merely touch upon this punctuation at this time, leaving it for fuller
                                               ,                      

discussion later.
                .




As the context is often necessary to show the real meaning of a word,
                                                                    ,

we will supply it for our first example.
                                       .




In response to a request to be excused from school, a teacher informs a
                                                  ,                    

pupil that he may go later. At a later hour the teacher says to him:
                          .                                        :




  5. Now you may go.
   .               .




The word “now” is here expressive purely of time, and suggests no
         “   ”                                  ,                

other meaning than that obtained at the first reading. The sentence is
                                                     .                

another form of “You may go now,” which requires no punctuation other
                “              ,”                                    

than the period. The word “now,” as here used, is an adverb expressing
               .          “   ,”             ,                        

time.
    .




In a similarly formed sentence the office of the word may be quite
                                                                  

different; and, in order to show this fact, the comma is used.
         ;    ,                           ,                  .




  5-1. Now we see we that cannot learn to punctuate until we comprehend
   - .                                                                 

  the fundamental principles underlying the relations between groups of
                                                                       

  words, as well as the fundamental principles underlying the use of
       ,                                                            

  marks. Now, what are we going to do about it?
       .    ,                                 ?




In No. 5-1 the first “now” conveys a sufficient idea of time to stand
     .  -            “   ”                                           

as an adverb, just as “now” does in No. 5; but the second “now” is
            ,         “   ”           .  ;                “   ”   

a mere expletive. To show that it does not sustain its _apparent_
                .                                                

relation, the relation of time, to the remainder of the clause, it is
        ,                     ,                               ,      

cut off by a comma.
                  .







RECAPITULATION
              




Let us now review and recapitulate the points we have tried to
                                                              

establish in our study thus far:
                               :




1. The meaning of language depends very largely upon the groupings
 .                                                                

of its words. In very simple language, words are so placed that each
            .                        ,                              

word is related to a word or words immediately or closely following or
                                                                      

preceding it. In such language the reader is hardly conscious that the
            .                                                         

words are grouped, except into sentences; and no mark may be required,
                 ,                      ;                            ,

except the end-mark.
              -    .




2. In more complex language the grouping within the sentence becomes
 .                                                                  

manifest to the reader, and two constructions and two meanings of
                      ,                                          

the language often become possible. In order to notify the reader
                                  .                              

which meaning the language is intended to convey, the writer may put
                                                ,                   

a sign-board at the point where the meaning may be mistaken. The
      -                                                    .    

reader reads the sign-board, and thus keeps on the right line of
                     -     ,                                    

thought-development.
       -           .




3. In the sentences thus far studied, except No. 3-1, marks were used
 .                                  ,          .  - ,                

simply to aid the reader to catch the meaning quickly by avoiding a
                                                                   

wrong grouping of words. In No. 3-1 the meaning of the language was
                       .      .  -                                 

entirely changed by the marks.
                             .

CHAPTER II
          




THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF PUNCTUATION—GROUPING
                                      —        







We endeavored to show in Chapter I that the fundamental purpose of
                                                                  

punctuation is to group by means of marks words whose relations in
                                                                  

the absence of marks would be either easily mistaken or not quickly
                                                                   

apprehended.
           .




When to use a mark, and what mark to use, are determined by _reason_ or
                  ,                     ,                              

by _convention_.
               .




Some of the _conventions_ that determine a punctuation familiar to most
                                                                       

people, together with some of the problems that confront us in our
      ,                                                           

study, are exhibited in the punctuation of the following sentence:
     ,                                                           :




  5A. Mr. Smith came to the city in 1872, and located at 1872 Wabash
    .   .                               ,                           

  Avenue. He brought with him 1,872 horses, valued at $187,200.00.
        .                      ,          ,           $   ,   .  .




How does punctuation enable the reader to obtain the meaning at one
                                                                   

point in the above sentence, and so to group the language (figures) at
                           ,                              (       )   

another point that he can apprehend the meaning at a glance? Because of
                                                           ?           

well-nigh universal usage, the above _date_ and _street_ numbers are
    -                    ,                                          

read _eighteen hundred seventy-two_; but the same number in the next
                              -    ;                                

sentence is read _one thousand eight hundred seventy-two_. As we all
                                                    -    .          

know, in arithmetical notation three figures form a group, the groups
    ,                                                    ,           

so formed being named _units_, _thousands_, _millions_, etc. It is
                             ,            ,           ,    .      

therefore evident that, in reading a number containing two or more such
                      ,                                                

groups, the eye will be aided if the groups are indicated by some mark.
      ,                                                               .

(We here use the comma and the period for this purpose.) Although the
(                                                     .)             

left-hand group of a number may not be full, a figure in that group
    -                                      ,                       

takes the name of the group, and so we mark it off. Thus we use commas
                           ,                      .                   

in two of the numbers in our example, one of which (1,872) has only
                                    ,              ( ,   )         

one figure in the second (thousand) group. This we call punctuation by
                         (        )      .                            

reason, for we thus point off natural groups.
      ,                                     .




We do not use the comma to group the figures in the same number (1872)
                                                                (    )

used in two other places in the above example. Because date and street
                                             .                        

numbers of four figures are read in groups of two figures each the eye
                                                                      

readily does the grouping, and a mark is not needed as an aid in the
                         ,                                          

grouping. This is also punctuation by reason.
        .                                   .




In the fourth number in our example we use a comma to do one grouping,
                                                                     ,

and a period to make another (the cents) group. We call the use of the
                             (         )      .                       

period in this number _conventional_ punctuation.
                                                .




Many printing-offices do not punctuate a number containing less
             -                                                 

than five figures. Such a rule would call for 9999 and 10,000. This
                 .                                       ,   .     

is purely arbitrary punctuation. Our problem is to find, as far as
                               .                       ,          

possible, a reason for the use of every mark, and to point out what
        ,                                   ,                      

seems to us good conventional usage in punctuation for which we can
                                                                   

find no reason.
              .







THE NAMES OF MARKS
                  




The names of the principal marks were given to them by the Greek
                                                                

grammarians, the name of each mark being the name of the group of
           ,                                                     

words with which the mark was used. The group of words which we call a
                                  .                                   

_sentence_, they called a _period_. They arbitrarily marked its end by
          ,                       .                                   

a dot, and called the dot also a “period.” We retain the name of the
     ,                           “      .”                          

mark. They called one of the largest divisions of a sentence a _limb_,
    .                                                                ,

and set it off with a mark called the “kolon,” which means a limb. We
                                      “     ,”                   .   

retain the name of the mark in our word colon. The same is true of the
                                             .                        

mark we still call a _comma_. The _semicolon_ is a mark of later date;
                            .                                        ;

and, as its name implies, it falls between the comma and the colon in
   ,                    ,                                            

its character and use.
                     .







THE RELATIVE VALUES OF MARKS
                            




We still recognize, at least in large measure, the values given the
                  ,                          ,                     

marks by the Greek grammarians; and the principle is important in our
                              ;                                      

study. Thus we say, of the four principal marks the comma indicates
     .            ,                                                

the slightest degree of separation between groups of words within a
                                                                   

sentence; the semicolon indicates the next larger division; and the
        ;                                                 ;        

colon indicates the largest division. The period separates a full
                                    .                            

sentence from the sentence standing next to it; and it is also used
                                              ;                    

when a sentence stands alone.
                            .







We have seen the need of marks in the above illustrative sentences,
                                                                  ,

and have also seen _where_ the marks were needed; but we had to
                                                ;              

_assume_ that the comma was the proper mark to use. We now know the
                                                  .                

relative values given the marks by the Greek grammarians. If our

grammar, teaches us that the degree of separation between the groups
       ,                                                            

of words where we found the need of a mark, was the least degree
                                          ,                     

requiring a mark, then the comma was the proper mark to use. With this
                ,                                          .

the comma intelligently settled, we can assert that we punctuated our

Reading this sentence with the knowledge of the comma already gained,

we reach the end of the first fairly complete group of words, where we
                                                            ,         

meet a semicolon. Let us challenge this mark, or sign-board, for its
                .                           ,        -     ,

       .          ,                                                    

the _comma_ relation to what has preceded, as would be the case if the
                                         ,                            

sentence continued in the following way:

  6-1. Athens’ freedom and her power have, for more than twenty

  luxury.
        .




The semicolon, on the contrary, says that the group of words to follow
             ,                ,                                       

is of equal rank with the whole group which has preceded the mark; and
                                                                 ;    

it thus shows how the sentence is to develop. The next semicolon in No.
                                            .                         .

way. This makes easy reading up to the colon, which, being followed by
   .                                        ,      ,                  

“but,” is to mark the _extent_ of the _but_ relation between what is
“   ,”                                                              

to follow and what has preceded. The meaning of the colon, as learned
                               .                         ,           

from its original use, tells the reader that the sentence is divided
                     ,                                              

into members, or “limbs”; and therefore the _but_ relation here is
            ,    “     ”;                                         

between all that precedes and all that is to follow, for these groups
                                                   ,                 

constitute the limbs of the sentence. If what follows the colon was to
                                    .                                 

be tied to less than all that precedes, the _but_ relation could extend
                                      ,                                

only to the last semicolon, thus completing this particular group. It
                          ,                                      .   

is very evident that the _but_ relation could not terminate in the
                                                                  

midst of language tied together as are the groups preceding “but” in
                                                            “   ”   

this sentence; and yet many good writers use the semicolon, instead
             ;                                            ,        

of the colon, in sentences like this, probably, however, without
            ,                       ,         ,        ,        

considering what grouping is thus made.
                                      .




The entire sentence is divided into two groups by the colon, as the
                                                           ,       

sense relation manifestly requires. If we change the order of the two
                                  .                                  

larger groups in No. 6, the colon will be the first mark reached by the
                   .  ,                                                

reader; and it will give him notice of what is to follow:
      ;                                                 :




  6-2. Athens’ intellectual empire is imperishable: but her freedom
   - .       ’                                    :                

  and her powers have, for more than twenty centuries, been annihilated
                     ,                               ,                 

  ...
  ...




Here the colon, if challenged for its meaning, would say that all that
              ,                              ,                        

follows it in the sentence is to form one group in the _but_ relation
                                                                     

to all that precedes, with the further information that what follows
                    ,                                               

is to be divided into groups by semicolons, thus requiring the colon
                                          ,                         

to divide the sentence into two main parts. A semicolon at this point
                                          .                          

would have given another reply, and would not have been followed by
                              ,                                    

other semicolons.
                .




Probably the beginner in the study of punctuation will not fully
                                                                

comprehend this discussion of Sentence 6 and its modifications; but the
                                                              ;        

discussion may throw some additional light on the _disjunctive_ and
                                                                   

_grouping_ office of the four marks, including the period at the end of
                                   ,                                   

the sentence.
            .







We will now consider a sentence in which the grouping, with its
                                                     ,         

consequent punctuation, is at once very simple and very subtle. It is
                      ,                                       .      

subtle because it is based upon the subtle meanings of the language;
                                                                   ;

and yet it becomes very simple when the language is understood:
                                                              :




  7. The following are the names of the Deity and of Jesus Christ:
   .                                                             :




  1. Jehovah, Lord, God Almighty; Creator, Father, Preserver, Governor;
   .        ,     ,             ;        ,       ,          ,         ;

  the Supreme Being; the Holy Spirit.
                   ;                .




  2. The Messiah, the Anointed; the Son, the Savior, the Redeemer; the
   .            ,             ;        ,           ,             ;    

  Holy One; Prophet, Teacher, Master; Judge of the World.
          ;        ,        ,       ;                   .




Commas would be sufficient here to indicate what word or group of words
                                                                       

constitutes a name; but there is additional information in the grouping
                  ;                                                    

of names which the writer desires to convey, and which, perhaps, would
                                           ,          ,        ,      

not appear to many readers if attention were not directed to it by
                                                                  

proper grouping, which is done here by semicolons. It will be seen that
               ,                                 .                     

the number of names in a group in the above example varies from one to
                                                                      

four.
    .




What information does this grouping convey, and upon what is the
                                          ,                     

grouping based? The words in the first group are the primary terms for
              ?                                                       

the Deity (Exodus vi, 2, 3); in the second group, the names of the
          (         ,  ,  );                    ,                 

Deity which express His relation to man; etc.
                                       ;    .




The next sentence shows a similar grouping, but a grouping based upon
                                          ,                          

more familiar and more marked characteristics of the things grouped:
                                                                   :




  7-1. Among the chief products of Minnesota are the following: wheat,
   - .                                                        :      ,

  corn, and oats; potatoes, beets, beans, etc.; butter and cheese;
      ,         ;         ,      ,      ,    .;                  ;

  lumber; iron; etc.
        ;     ;    .




The semicolon grouping here needs no explanation, although the use
                                                ,                 

of a mark at one point in the sentence may seem at variance with the
                                                                    

punctuation at another point. In the second group a comma is used
                            .                                    

before “etc.”; and at the end of the sentence a semicolon precedes
       “   .”;                                                    

“etc.” The punctuation is consistent with the uses of the two marks in
“   .”                                                                

other parts of the sentence. In the second group the comma says the
                           .                                       

_group_ is not complete; and therefore “etc.” stands for unexpressed
                       ;               “   .”                       

items of the group, such, for instance, as _peas_. The last semicolon
                  ,     ,             ,          .                   

indicates to the reader that there are other groups; for instance,
                                                   ;             ,

_cattle, sheep, and hogs_ might constitute a group.
       ,      ,                                   .




Many readers pass over punctuation of this kind; and they do not
                                               ;                

understand, or seek to understand, the meaning of such grouping as that
          ,                      ,                                     

in No. 7, while, because of its simplicity, that in No. 7-1 scarcely
     .  ,      ,                          ,           .  -          

attracts their attention.
                        .







In the next sentence the grouping is informing and somewhat striking.
                                                                    .

The sentence, with a slight modification, is taken from a U. S. Census
            ,                           ,                  .  .       

Report:
      :




  7-2. I have the honor to transmit herewith statistical tables of
   - .                                                            

  mortality; the insane, feeble-minded, deaf and dumb, and blind;
           ;           ,       -      ,              ,          ;

  crime, pauperism, and benevolence; education; churches; foreign-born
       ,          ,                ;          ;         ;        -    

  population; and manufactures.
            ;                 .




The third group in this sentence is particularly striking, for it
                                                         ,       

suggests the relationship between crime and pauperism, and the
                                                     ,        

consequent private effort, in the form of benevolence, to deal with a
                         ,                           ,               

social condition with which every government must deal.
                                                      .




Thus in Sentence 7-2 the grouping by semicolons imparts information
                  -                                                

which might be readily overlooked.
                                 .







PUNCTUATION OF A SERIES
                       




Sentence 7-2 suggests two uses of the comma to be found in the simplest
          -                                                            

sentences, one of which uses we almost take for granted, and the
         ,                                             ,        

other is a mooted use. Why do we use the comma between nouns standing
                     .                                               

together? and why do we omit it before the first “and,” and use it
        ?                                        “   ,”           

before the next “and,” in the second group (the insane, feeble-minded,
                “   ,”                     (          ,       -      ,

deaf and dumb, and blind)?
             ,          )?




We answer that each use is based upon the fundamental principle of
                                                                  

punctuation, the principle of _disjunction_, which distinguishes
           ,                               ,                    

between the _apparent_ and the _real_ meaning of words or groups of
                                                                   

words standing together.
                       .




It may be said, with apparent good reason, that no comma is absolutely
              ,                          ,                            

necessary to separate the second and third nouns in such a group as
                                                                   

“wheat, corn, and oats”; and it is quite common practice not to use
“     ,     ,         ”;                                           

a comma before the final “and” in such a group. While this practice
                         “   ”                .                    

may be correct, it is to be remembered that we are seeking helpful
              ,                                                   

punctuation, not the absolutely necessary in each instance; and the
           ,                                              ;        

most helpful punctuation is that which is most nearly uniform in its
                                                                    

treatment of cases falling into well-defined classes.
                                    -               .




As we are now considering what is technically called a _series_, it
                                                               ,   

is well to consider the value of consistency in the punctuation of a
                                                                    

series. A few examples will illustrate this point:
      .                                          :




  8. William Henry and James are at school.
   .                                      .




The words in the above stand in the natural order and relations to
                                                                  

express thought in almost the simplest form of language. “William” is a
                                                       . “       ”     

noun sustaining to “Henry” the adjective relation, just as it would do
                   “     ”                       ,                    

in the name _William Smith_, even though our grammars give it another
                           ,                                         

relation. If we do not wish it to stand in this relation and to convey
        .                                                             

this meaning, we disconnect the two words by a comma:
            ,                                       :




  8-1. William, Henry and James are at school.
   - .        ,                              .




This sentence names three boys; and its meaning is unmistakable at a
                              ;                                     

glance.
      .




We saw in Sentence 1 the tendency of the reader to combine in one group
                                                                       

words connected by “and,” which is the natural manner of reading.
                   “   ,”                                       .

Because of this fact, notice is to be given by punctuation when “and”
                    ,                                           “   ”

does not connect the words between which it stands, unless notice is
                                                  ,                 

given in another way, as it often is. As Sentence 8-1 is written,
                    ,               .              -            ,

“Henry and James” appears to constitute a group to be followed by other
“               ”                                                      

words in a series, just as is the case in the second group of No. 7-2.
                 ,                                              .  - .

This tendency to wrong grouping will be seen in reading the following
                                                                     

sentence:
        :




  8-2. Among the earliest colleges established in America were Yale,
   - .                                                             ,

  Trinity, William and Mary, and Harvard.
         ,                 ,            .




In this sentence one college (William and Mary) is named by a group of
                             (                )                       

words connected by “and,” this group being followed by another name
                   “   ,”                                          

also connected by “and” to what precedes. All punctuators admit that
                  “   ”                 .                           

such grouping imperatively demands a comma before the final “and,” for
                                                            “   ,”    

without the comma the reader could not possibly ascertain from the
                                                                  

language the names of the colleges.
                                  .




As such grouping is very common, and as the tendency to group together
                               ,                                      

words connected by “and” is quite natural, the use of the comma
                   “   ”                 ,                     

before the final “and” in every series is _helpful_ punctuation. This
                 “   ”                                         .     

punctuation makes the absence of the comma before “and” give notice
                                                  “   ”            

that a group of words within, and not at the end of, the series, is
                            ,                      ,           ,   

reached. For this reason it is well to make the punctuation of every
       .                                                            

series uniform.
              .




This punctuation requires a comma before “and” in No. 8-1:
                                         “   ”      .  - :




  8-3. William, Henry, and James are at school.
   - .        ,      ,                        .




Unless one, in reading aloud, exhibits the grouping by
          ,                 ,                         

voice-inflection, his hearers may not comprehend the meaning conveyed
     -          ,                                                    

by the grouping. Failure thus to show the grouping in No. 8-2 would
               .                                        .  -       

utterly confuse the hearer as to the names of the two colleges
                                                              

designated by a group of words in which two “ands” appear. This
                                            “    ”       .     

relation between voice-inflection and punctuation is considered in our

                                            .




A possible and apparent exception to the punctuation exhibited in No.
                                                                    .

8-3 may be demanded in the punctuation of a very familiar group of
 -                                                                

words, the address line of a speech:
     ,                             :




  8-4. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen.
   - .   .          ,                     .




The voice-inflection of almost every speaker who uses these words,
         -                                                       ,

as well as of almost every person who reads them aloud, exhibits a
                                                      ,           

grouping that inhibits the use of a comma before “and.” In other words,
                                                 “   .”               ,

the people addressed by the speaker are divided into two groups,—the
                                                               ,—   

“president” constituting one group, and “ladies and gentlemen” another.
“         ”                       ,     “                    ”        .

This grouping is exhibited by the voice-inflection of the speaker or
                                       -                            

reader and by the omission of a comma before “and” by the printer.
                                             “   ”               .




If, on the other hand, three groups are to be made of the persons
  ,                  ,                                           

addressed, the voice-inflection and the punctuation (a comma before
         ,          -                               (              

“and”) should show the grouping.
“   ”)                         .




In the absence of a comma before “and” in this group, the language of
                                 “   ”              ,                

the group does not constitute what we technically call a “series”; and
                                                         “      ”;    

therefore the omission of the comma is only an _apparent_ exception to
                                                                      

the punctuation of a series.
                           .




We call attention to the punctuation of this group of words because
                                                                   

we find it in the two Manuals issued by the University of Chicago
                                                                 

Press. It is there printed without an explanation of the omission of
     .                                                              

the comma, although such omission is contrary to the rule given in
         ,                                                        

each Manual for the punctuation of a series, while the words appear
                                           ,                       

in another place in one of the Manuals with a comma before “and.” The
                                                           “   .”    

words appear in the Manuals as illustrations of the use of capitals and
                                                                       

italics, and not in connection with punctuation.
       ,                                       .




It may be well to recall that the relation between any two words
                                                                

or groups of words in a series is the relation shown by the final
                                                                 

conjunction. If expressed, this conjunction is either “and” or “or”; if
           .             ,                            “   ”    “  ”;   

not expressed, it is practically always “and.”
             ,                          “   .”




It is a quite common practice to use a comma before the final “and”
                                                              “   ”

in a series requiring semicolons between the preceding groups. This
                                                             .     

punctuation often leaves the reader in doubt as to whether the “and”
                                                               “   ”

completes a group or ends the series; therefore the better punctuation
                                    ;                                 

is to use a semicolon before the final “and” in such a series.
                                       “   ”                 .




The value of grouping is further shown in the following sentence:
                                                                :




  9. There are no better cosmetics than temperance and purity, modesty
   .                                                         ,        

  and humility, a gracious temper and calmness of spirit.
              ,                                         .




We group the words in this sentence for the same reason that the words
                                                                      

are grouped in Nos. 7, 7-1, and 7-2. It is simply natural grouping
                  .  ,  - ,      - .                              

based upon the sense of the language.
                                    .




How much would be lost in the absence of such grouping may be seen by
                                                                     

breaking up the simple groups in No. 9:
                                   .  :




  9-1. There are no better cosmetics than temperance, purity, modesty,
   - .                                              ,       ,        ,

  humility, a gracious temper, and calmness of spirit.
          ,                  ,                       .




The punctuation of No. 9-1 is just as correct as that of No. 9; but
                     .  -                                  .  ;    

it is purely mechanical and not “elegant.” Forceful grouping, with or
                                “       .”                  ,        

without grouping words, requires proper punctuation.
                      ,                            .




Another quite simple form of this grouping, based upon the sense
                                          ,                     

relation, is sometimes overlooked by distinguished writers, and even by
        ,                                                 ,            

authors of text-books on language. The following sentence exhibits both
               -                 .                                     

a correct grouping and a correct sense relation:
                                               :




  10. He is in doubt about the best course for him to pursue; but I am
    .                                                       ;         

  sure about the best course for me to pursue.
                                             .




Here the _but_ relation is between _his doubt_ and _my certainty_, as
                                                                 ,   

if written, _He is in doubt; but I am sure_.
          ,                ;               .




A similarly formed sentence may convey a meaning that is clearly not
                                                                    

the meaning the writer wishes to convey:
                                       :




  10-1. He is in doubt about the best course for him to pursue; but I
    - .                                                       ;      

  am sure his doubt will soon disappear.
                                       .




The _but_ relation in No. 10-1 is not between _his doubt_ and _my
                        .   -                                    

certainty_, as in No. 10. The meaning of No. 10-1 may be expressed
          ,         .   .                  .   -                  

thus: _He is in doubt; but his doubt will soon disappear_. But the
    :                ;                                   .        

assertion made in the latter part of this statement is too strong,
                                                                 ,

and requires a modifier. “Probably” would nearly express the meaning
                       . “        ”                                 

intended to be expressed by the modifier in No. 10-1. If “I am sure” is
                                              .   - .    “         ”   

preferred as the modifier, its relation to the verb (will disappear)
                         ,                          (              )

must be made unmistakable. It is not so made in No. 10-1, for it
                         .                        .   - ,       

appears to be connected by “but” with what precedes it, just as it is
                           “   ”                      ,              

connected with what precedes it in No. 10. To disconnect it, a comma
                                     .   .                 ,        

precedes it; and one follows it to disconnect it from what follows.
           ;                                                      .




The new relations are shown by the following punctuation:
                                                        :




  10-2. He is in doubt about the best course for him to pursue; but, I
    - .                                                       ;    ,  

  am sure, his doubt will soon disappear.
         ,                              .




Suppose the sentence read as follows, how would it be punctuated?
                                    ,                           ?




  10-3. He is in doubt about the best course for him to pursue; but I
    - .                                                       ;      

  am sure that his doubt will soon disappear.
                                            .




This sentence cannot be punctuated. The _but_ relation is here between
                                  .                                   

incongruous thoughts; and therefore the sentence must be mended, which
                    ;                                          ,      

can be done by making it like No. 10-2, omitting “that.”
                                .   - ,          “    .”




No amount of usage, even among good writers, can justify the absence of
                  ,                        ,                           

commas in No. 10-1, or the construction of No. 10-3.
            .   - ,                          .   - .




The discussion of these sentences emphasizes the necessity for
                                                              

observing the meaning of language as expressed by its grouping and by
                                                                     

the relation of one group to another.
                                    .




Additional light will be thrown upon some of the relations already
                                                                  

discussed if we consider them from another viewpoint, as we shall do in
                                                    ,                  

the next chapter.

Twain, and our weekly comic papers make us laugh anew over the same old
     ,                                                                 

story, told in different accents and in different syntax.

18. With one of his two boys or a friend, and a dog, Tennyson would
  .                                     ,          ,

19. With one of his two boys, or a friend and a dog, Tennyson would
  .                         ,                      ,               

walk afield for miles.
                     .




  In No. 18 the comma before “and” cuts “dog” off from “friend,” and
       .                     “   ”      “   ”          “      ,”    

  makes a group of “dog” and “one of his two boys or a friend.” It
                   “   ”     “                               .”   

  makes this group simply because the sense permits no other grouping.
                                                                     .

  Thus the meaning of No. 18 is, that Tennyson was accompanied by a dog
                        .      ,                                       

  and a person (one of his boys or a friend).
               (                           ).




  In No. 19 another grouping is made, which says Tennyson was
       .                            ,                        

  accompanied by one of his boys or by a friend and a dog.
                                                         .

EXPLANATORY AND RESTRICTIVE MODIFIERS
                                     




The Greek grammarians gave the name _parenthesis_ to a group of words
                                                                     

“thrust into” language, either spoken or written, when such words have
“           ”         ,                         ,                     

no _grammatical_ connection with the language. We retain the word
                                             .                   

“parenthesis” to describe such a group, and also as the name of the
“           ”                         ,                            

curved lines with which the group is enclosed and thus identified.
                                                                 .

These lines are called _parenthesis_, _marks of parenthesis_, or
                                    ,                       ,   

_parentheses_.
             .




Such matter is inserted for explanation or qualification; but it is not
                                                        ;              

essential to the meaning of the language into which it is thrust, for
                                                                ,    

matter essential to the meaning would not be so named or so marked.
                                                                  .




The parenthesis did the ancient writers a larger service in the
                                                               

involved style of their composition than it does modern writers;
                                                               ;

however, in a modified form, it does the modern writer a very useful
       ,                   ,                                        

and, at times, an indispensable service.
   ,         ,                         .




What we may call a _modified parenthesis_ (modified parenthetical
                                          (                      

matter) is found, one or more times, in almost every paragraph.
      )         ,                  ,                          .




In order to clarify or explain our adopted term, “modified
                                               , “        

parenthesis,” a parenthesis, enclosed in parentheses, was used in the
           ,”              ,                        ,

                           ;    ,                     ,            

qualify, in a somewhat peculiar manner, the expression “is found in
       ,                              ,                “           

every paragraph,” the modified parenthetical group of words “one or
               ,”                                           “      

more times” was inserted. We characterize this parenthesis as _somewhat
          ”             .                                              

peculiar_. In its literal meaning, “one or more times” adds nothing to
         .                       , “                 ”                

the statement in which it appears, for whatever occurs must occur “one
                                 ,                                “   

or more times.” It does, however, add a new and perhaps subtle thought
             .”        ,        ,

                                                        .




The meanings of these terms, together with the reasons for their
                           ,                                    

punctuation, will appear as we discuss illustrative examples:
           ,                                                :




  11. The author says (page 5) that he did not go to London.
    .                 (      )                             .




The words “page 5” were inserted in the above sentence by the writer
          “      ”                                                  

himself simply as a matter of direction to the place in the book where
                                                                      

the assertion was made. It has no grammatical connection with any part
                      .                                               

of the sentence: it is simply “thrust in”—it is “parenthetical.” We may
               :              “         ”—      “             .”       

modify its strictly parenthetical nature by putting it in another form:
                                                                      :




  11-1. The author says, on page 5, that he did not go to London.
    - .                ,          ,                             .




Here the expression “on page 5” has still the parenthetical nature; but
                    “         ”                                   ;    

it is given grammatical connection, by means of the preposition “on,”
                                  ,                             “  ,”

to what precedes it. Thus we call it a “modified parenthesis”; or we
                   .                   “                    ”;      

may call it “slightly parenthetical” matter. It is obvious that the
            “                      ”       .                       

expression can be omitted in either No. 11 or No. 11-1 without the
                                      .         .   -             

slightest effect upon the meaning of the sentence.
                                                 .




If we omit the commas in No. 11-1, we give the sentence practically a
                           .   - ,                                   

new meaning; and to complete the meaning a new clause must be added:
           ;                                                       :




  11-2. The author says on page 5 that he did not go to London; but he
    - .                                                       ;       

  says on page 6 that he did go to London.
                                         .




In No. 11-2 the language is used in its natural order; and no mark is
     .   -                                           ;               

required in either clause, for each group of words has its natural
                         ,                                        

or logical relation to the group or groups standing next to it. The
                                                              .    

meaning is unmistakable. But why was the comma used in No. 11-1 and
                       .                                 .   -     

not in No. 11-2? Let us note carefully that we are still dealing
         .   - ?                                                

with the proper grouping of words and with the relations of group to
                                                                    

group, such relations giving rise to _real_ and _apparent_ meanings.
     ,                                                             .

With the real meaning of such groups as we are now considering fully
                                                                    

understood, we know that a mark is used to change that meaning. Thus,
          ,                                                   .     ,

in the consideration of these sentences, we come back to the principle
                                       ,                              

exemplified in Sentences 1 and 2. We use the commas in No. 11-1 because
                                .                        .   -         

the real meaning of the sentence is not the same as the meaning of the
                                                                      

same language in No. 11-2.
                   .   - .




One or two illustrative sentences will lead us, gradually and
                                              ,              

logically, to the punctuation of a large class of sentences in which
         ,                                                          

the groups of words considered have somewhat more definite names than
                                                                     

we have given the same groups in the above sentences.
                                                    .




A thorough comprehension of this punctuation is often indispensable,
                                                                   ,

that the writer may convey to the reader his exact meaning, which may
                                                          ,          

depend entirely upon the punctuation,—that is, upon the _absence_ or
                                    ,—       ,                      

the _presence_ of marks:
                       :




  12. Everywhere in America and England, as well as in Germany, the cry
    .                                  ,                      ,        

  for peace is heard.
                    .




What does the language of No. 12 mean? Clearly, that in every part
                            .        ?        ,                   

(everywhere) of America and in every part of England, as well as
(          )                                        ,           

in every part of Germany, the cry for peace is heard. That is the
                        ,                           .            

_apparent_, and it is also the _real_, meaning of the language; but the
          ,                          ,                        ;        

writer may have had a different meaning in mind. If he did not wish to
                                               .                      

limit the “cry for peace” to America, England, and Germany, he would
          “             ”           ,        ,            ,         

have disconnected from “everywhere” these limiting words, writing the
                       “          ”                     ,            

sentence thus:
             :




  12-1. Everywhere, in America and England, as well as in Germany, the
    - .           ,                       ,                      ,    

  cry for peace is heard.
                        .




The use of the first comma in this grouping notifies the reader that
                                                                    

a grouping different from the apparent grouping must be made. It also
                                                            .        

notifies him that a meaning different from that of No. 12 is to be
                                                     .            

conveyed by the new grouping. The second comma readily falls into its
                            .                                        

place; and by the same reasoning the third comma is called for.
     ;                                                        .




The two groups are slightly parenthetical; and, treated as one group,
                                         ;    ,                     ,

they could be set off by parentheses.
                                    .




  12-2. Everywhere (in America and England, as well as in Germany) the
    - .            (                      ,                      )    

  cry for peace is heard.
                        .




They are not _properly_ included in marks of parenthesis, because they
                                                        ,             

do not constitute a pure parenthesis. They are inserted, not to explain
                                    .                  ,               

the word “everywhere,” but for emphasis, being equivalent in meaning
         “          ,”                 ,                            

to _even in America_, etc. It will be observed that “everywhere,” as
                    ,    .                          “          ,”   

here used, means in all parts of the world. Nothing can be added to it;
         ,                                .                           ;

and therefore what the group of words under consideration explains is,
                                                                     ,

that the word is used in its inclusive and exact meaning. The marks
                                                        .          

give a shade of meaning somewhat similar to that given by commas in
                                                                   

setting off “one or more times,” discussed above.
            “                 ,”                .




It may be noted, in passing, that the middle (the second) comma in No.
               ,           ,                 (          )            .

12-1 acts with the first comma to form one group and with the third
  -                                                                

comma to form another group, thus making the three commas equivalent to
                           ,                                           

two pairs of commas.
                   .







Our next sentence is an exceedingly interesting one. It has been
                                                   .            

submitted for interpretation to a number of persons, including
                                                   ,          

editorial writers, authors, teachers, lawyers, and printers. Not a
                 ,        ,         ,        ,             .      

single one of them saw the real meaning; and, when the meaning was
                                       ;    ,                     

pointed out, not one of them could explain why the commas are used.
           ,                                                      .

Moreover, not one of the score or more of text-books on punctuation at
        ,                                     -                       

hand gives a satisfactory explanation. The rules of all the books, it
                                     .                           ,   

is true, cover the point; but the application of the rules is often so
       ,                ;                                             

difficult as to render them valueless.
                                     .




When understood, the sentence is simplicity itself, and the punctuation
               ,                                  ,                    

becomes equally simple and very informing.
                                         .




The sentence (No. 13) is a part of a larger sentence taken from an
             (  .   )                                             

essay on “Literature and Education” by Dr. Henry van Dyke, the larger
         “                        ”      .               ,           

sentence being one of several directions how to determine the value of
                                                                      

a story:
       :




  13. Ask whether the people in the story develop, for better or for
    .                                            ,                  

  worse.
       .




Let us suggest that the reader study the sentence before proceeding
                                                                   

with our discussion of it. Let him put the sentence in the form of a
                         .                                          

question, and apply it to any story he has recently read. What two
        ,                                               .         

answers could be given to the question if applied to two stories
                                                                

requiring different answers?
                           ?




Now let us ask why the comma is used. The answer is simple, for
                                    .                     ,    

in our study of marks we have had only _one_ reason for using the
                                                                 

comma,—namely, to show that an _apparent_ meaning is not the _real_
     ,—      ,                                                     

meaning. If this is the reason for the use of the comma, the reason
       .                                               ,           

will be exemplified by a study of the sentence without the comma:
                                                                :




  13-1. Ask whether the people in the story develop for better or for
    - .                                                              

  worse.
       .




If the meaning of each sentence is not yet clear, let us consider the
                                                ,                    

group of words following the comma in No. 13 as slightly parenthetical
                                        .                             

(a modified parenthesis). We may go a step further, and treat them as
(                      ).                         ,                  

purely parenthetical, putting them in marks of parenthesis and putting
                    ,                                                 

the sentence in the interrogative form:
                                      :




  13-2. Do the people in the story develop (for better or for worse)?
    - .                                    (                       )?




Manifestly, the only answer is _yes_ or _no_.
          ,                                 .




Why did Dr. van Dyke add these slightly parenthetical and apparently
          .                                                         

superfluous words (for better or for worse) to his sentence? He added
                  (                       )                ?         

them, primarily, because he knew some, perhaps many, readers might
    ,          ,                     ,             ,              

think “develop” means only growth upward (for better), while it is
      “       ”                          (          ),            

just as essential for the novelist to depict characters that “develop”
                                                             “       ”

_downward_ (for worse) as _upward_.
           (         )            .




But what does No. 13-1 mean? If put in the form of a question, what
                .   -      ?                                 ,     

answer can be given? Only “for better” or “for worse.” This changes
                   ?      “          ”    “         .”             

the meaning of the language. The first sentence (No. 13) asks whether
                           .                    (  .   )             

the people in the story are static or dynamic; the second (No. 13-1)
                                             ;            (  .   - )

assumes that they are dynamic (they develop), and asks in what
                              (            ),                 

direction they develop.
                      .




Dr. van Dyke’s entire sentence clearly shows the meaning of the part of
  .         ’                                                          

it we have been considering. The sentence is as follows:
                           .                           :




  13-3. Ask whether the people in the story develop, for better or for
    - .                                            ,                  

  worse, and how far the change is credible and significant.
       ,                                                   .




The groups of words we have been considering in Sentences 11 to 13-3
                                                                  - 

are either _restrictive_ or _explanatory_ groups, with the functions of
                                                ,                      

nouns, adjectives, or adverbs, and with the relations that these parts
     ,           ,           ,                                        

of speech take in the construction of language.
                                              .




The meanings of the terms “restrictive” and “explanatory” will appear
                          “           ”     “           ”            

as we consider other sentences; and the differentiation in the
                              ;                               

punctuation of restrictive and explanatory groups will be plain.
                                                               .







Our next sentence will serve a twofold purpose: first, to show how
                                              :      ,            

difficult it is to punctuate a sentence out of its context; and,
                                                          ;    ,

secondly, to show that a sentence may be given two meanings by
        ,                                                     

punctuation:
           :




  14. The boy who is at home is my best pupil.
    .                                        .




  14-1. The boy, who is at home, is my best pupil.
    - .        ,               ,                 .




The person who is thoroughly familiar with the _reasons_ for the use
                                                                    

of marks can interpret these sentences; and he can also construct a
                                      ;                            

context requiring the commas or their omission. On the other hand, one
                                              .                  ,    

not familiar with such reasons could probably do neither.
                                                        .




The value of this knowledge is quite inestimable. Because of ignorance
                                                .                     

of it on the part of legislators, our courts have been required to
                                ,                                 

determine the meanings of municipal, state, and national laws involving
                                   ,      ,                            

vital social relations and vast financial interests.
                                                   .




Applying the general principles already discussed, we say that the
                                                 ,                

first comma in No. 14-1 is to show that the relation between “boy” and
                 .   -                                       “   ”    

“who is my best pupil” is not the same relation that exists between the
“                    ”                                                 

same groups in No. 14. But why is this? Let us construct contexts for
                 .   .                ?                              

the sentences, and then study them in the light of the information thus
             ,                                                         

obtained.
        .




Suppose a visitor to a school asks the teacher about a certain class,
                                                                    ,

and the teacher replies as follows:
                                  :




  14-2. The class is composed of six boys. The boy who is at home is my
    - .                                  .                             

  best pupil.
            .




The group of words “who is at home” is an adjective; and the meaning
                   “              ”                ;                

of the noun with the qualification made by the adjective may be thus
                                                                    

expressed: _the at-home boy_. In this form the group specifies _what_
         :        -         .                                        

boy, and so _restricts_ the boy named as to mean a certain, definite
   ,                                                      ,         

boy.
   .




We here take the language in its natural order, and obtain a definite
                                              ,                      

and clearly understood meaning.
                              .




Another context will show a different relation. The teacher replies as
                                              .                       

follows:
       :




  14-3. The class is composed of one boy and five girls. The boy, who
    - .                                                .        ,    

  is at home, is my best pupil.
            ,                 .




Because of the context, “the boy” needs no identification, no
                      , “       ”                        ,   

restrictive words to explain who is meant. The sentence could be
                                         .                      

written thus:
            :




  14-4. The class is composed of one boy and five girls. The boy (he is
    - .                                                .         (     

  at home) is my best pupil.
         )                 .




In the above sentence the group of words in parentheses _explains_; but
                                                                  ;    

it is not _restrictive_. It tells something about the boy; but it does
                       .                                 ;            

not tell _what_ boy, for this information is given in what precedes,
                   ,                                               ,

which says there is only one boy. In No. 14-3 this group of words is
                                .      .   -                        

slightly changed, and is given grammatical connection by its form, and
                ,                                                ,    

thus it becomes only _slightly_ parenthetical.
                                             .




In Nos. 14 and 14-2 the meaning is not complete without the
      .          -                                         

_restrictive_ words. In Nos. 14-1, 14-3, and 14-4 these words are
                   .       .   - ,   - ,       -                 

not essential to identify the boy, being added simply by way of
                                 ,                             

explanation, hence they are called _explanatory_.
           ,                                    .




In the consideration of the terms _explanatory_ and _restrictive_,
                                                                 ,

much confusion arises from the fact that a restrictive group may
                                                                

also be an explanatory group. A purely _explanatory_ group, which
                            .                             ,      

requires commas to set it off, is never a _restrictive_ group. This
                             ,                               .     

confusion can be entirely avoided by calling the groups _restrictive_
                                                                     

and _non-restrictive_. The latter group is set off by commas because
        -            .                                              

it conveys a different meaning from that of a restrictive group, and
                                                               ,    

also because it is “slightly parenthetical,” that is, parenthetical in
                   “                      ,”        ,                 

nature, but with grammatical connection.
      ,                                .




Not a few writers use the marks of parenthesis or dashes, instead of
                                                        ,           

commas, to set off a non-restrictive (explanatory) group; but, as their
      ,                 -            (           )      ;    ,         

writings reveal no differentiation in the uses of these three marks,
                                                                   ,

their system of punctuation is a wholly hit-or-miss one.
                                           -  -        .







Because of the extent and importance of restrictive and non-restrictive
                                                           -           

groups of words, another like illustrative sentence, with its
               ,                                   ,         

variations, seems worth while:
          ,                  :




  15. The committee is composed of women who are not voters.
    .                                                      .




  15-1. The committee is composed of women, who are not voters.
    - .                                   ,                   .




  15-2. The committee is composed of men who are not voters.
    - .                                                    .




  15-3. The committee is composed of men, who are not voters.
    - .                                 ,                   .




What do these sentences really assert and what meanings do they convey?
                                                                      ?

Let us consider the answers to this question quite fully, and make them
                                                        ,              

a test of all restrictive and non-restrictive groups.
                                 -                  .




No. 15 says the members of the committee are not voters, implying that
  .                                                    ,              

other women are voters. The members of the committee might not be
                      .                                          

voters because of age, non-residence, etc.
                     ,    -         ,    .




No. 15-1 says all women are not voters,—that is, no women are voters.
  .   -                               ,—       ,                    .

The group “who are not voters” is explanatory of women.
          “                  ”                        .




No. 15-2 is the same as No. 15.

No. 15-3 is the same as No. 15-1; but, as men enjoy universal political

suffrage, the statement in No. 15-3 is somewhat more striking than that
        ,                    .   -

          .   - ,                                                      

to such an assertion. For instance, a woman’s society might admit men
                    .             ,        ’                         

to honorary membership in the society without the privilege of voting.
                                                                     .

If a committee was composed of such men, the statement made in No. 15-3
                                       ,                         .   - 

would be applicable.
                   .







Our next three sentences are perhaps more typical of the sentences met
                                                                      

in general reading:
                  :




  16. In 1826, an edition of this work, designed solely for printers,
    .        ,                        ,                             ,

  was first published.
                     .




Mr. Teall quotes the above sentence, among others from books on
  .                                ,                           

punctuation, and says that the commas setting off “designed solely for
           ,                                      “                   

printers” should be omitted.
        ”                  .




The sentence is from a late edition of Mr. Wilson’s work; and it shows
                                         .       ’      ;             

that author’s discriminating use of marks. The omission of the commas
           ’                             .                           

would entirely change the meaning of the language. The meaning of the
                                                 .                   

language may be more clearly expressed as follows:
                                                 :




  16-1. In 1826, the first edition of this work was published, and was
    - .        ,                                             ,        

  designed solely for printers.
                              .




With the commas omitted the meaning of the sentence would be as follows:
                                                                       :




  16-2. In 1826, the first edition of this work designed solely for
    - .        ,                                                   

  printers, was published.
          ,              .




Sentences 16 and 16-1 say that the first edition of the work was
                   -                                            

published in 1826. Sentence 16, with the commas omitted, as Mr. Teall
                 .            ,                        ,      .      

says they should be, and Sentence 16-2 say the first _printers’_
                   ,                -                         ’ 

edition was published in 1826; and they imply that other editions
                             ;                                   

not designed solely for printers were previously published. As no
                                                          .      

such edition was published, Mr. Teall is in error, and Mr. Wilson’s
                          ,   .                  ,       .       ’ 

punctuation (No. 16) is correct.
            (  .   )           .




Many writers set off such _explanatory_ or _slightly parenthetical_
                                                                   

modifiers by parentheses, as illustrated in Sentence 12-2; other
                        ,                              - ;      

writers use dashes for this purpose. As we shall show later, neither
                                   .                       ,        

mark finds sanction in punctuation by reason.
                                            .




  17. In medicine the anesthetic of choice is chloroform or ether; in
    .                                                            ;   

  dentistry it is laughing-gas, or nitrous oxide.
                          -   ,                 .




The conjunction “or” appears twice in the above sentence. In the first
                “  ”                                    .             

clause it stands between two words, one of which is excluded when the
                                  ,                                  

other is selected, just as if written “either chloroform or ether.” In
                 ,                    “                          .”   

the second clause a new relation between the words is set up. Here the
                                                            .         

apparent meaning is not the real meaning.
                                        .




In this second group the words following “or” are explanatory of the
                                         “  ”                       

word preceding “or.” One anesthetic with two names is spoken of. The
               “  .”                                           .    

comma notifies the reader that the relation in the second group is not
                                                                      

the relation existing in the first,—that is, the apparent relation in
                                  ,—       ,                         

the second group is not the _real_ relation.
                                           .




Many writers would put “or nitrous oxide” in parentheses. The meaning
                       “                ”               .            

would be unmistakable; but the punctuation is not commendable, as we
                     ;                                       ,      

have already seen. “Nitrous oxide,” without the “or,” could properly be
                 . “             ,”             “  ,”                  

enclosed in parentheses.
                       .







AFTERTHOUGHT
            




There is a very common use of the comma before “or” which reveals a
                                               “  ”                

nice meaning of language. The punctuation grows out of a writer’s
                        .                                      ’

word that is too strong. He follows this word with another in the _or_
                       .

                   -           .

words, and that the relation of explanation (slightly parenthetical),
     ,                                      (                      ),

principle of disjunction, exhibited in another form in the discussion
                        ,                                            

of Sentence 1, and uses the comma.
             ,                   .




In our first illustrative sentence (No. 17A) the fact that a word of
                                   (  .    )                        

milder, not coördinate, meaning is to follow “or,” is indicated both by
      ,               ,                      “  ,”                     

the group of words (I should say) and by the modifier (even) preceding
                   (            )                     (    )          

the word in the _or_ relation to “independent.” The comma before “or”
                                 “           .”                  “  ”

would be required in the absence of either or both of these modifiers,
                                                                     ,

as shown in Nos. 17A-1 and 17A-2. It is especially needed in No. 17A-2
               .    -         - .                              .    - 

to distinguish the _real_ from the _apparent_ meaning:
                                                     :




  17A. This capital does not make him independent, or, I should say,
     .                                           ,   ,             ,

  even aspiring.
               .




  17A-1. This capital does not make him independent, or even aspiring.
     - .                                           ,                 .




  17A-2. This capital does not make him independent, or aspiring.
     - .                                           ,            .




The word or words used in modification of an idea expressed either too
                                                                      

strongly or too weakly, are aptly called an “afterthought”; and such
                      ,                     “            ”;         

word or words themselves suggest the parenthetical nature of the added
                                                                      

language.
        .







Our next illustrative sentence shows the use of a word that is too
                                                                  

weak; and therefore the sense requires a stronger word. The sentence
    ;                                                 .             

is particularly interesting because it is a type of sentences that are
                                                                      

almost invariably punctuated wrong, even by our best writers:
                                  ,                         :




  18. It is a matter of whim, or, worse, of economy.
    .                       ,   ,      ,           .




The word “worse” is introduced to characterize what follows. It is a
         “     ”                                           .        

short form of “what is worse.” It requires a comma before it to cut it
              “             .”                                        

off from “or,” and a comma after it to cut it off from what follows.
         “  ,”                                                     .

When cut off, the sense relation between “whim” and “economy” is made
            ,                            “    ”     “       ”        

unmistakable. But sentences of this type are, as stated above, almost
            .                               ,                ,       

invariably punctuated wrong; and the sense relations are thus obscured.
                           ;                                          .

The wrong punctuation is as follows:
                                   :




  18-1. It is a matter of whim, or worse, of economy.
    - .                       ,         ,           .




In the next illustrative sentence (No. 18A) the new word is simply one
                                  (  .    )                           

that more nearly expresses the writer’s meaning. The comma before “or”
                                     ’         .                  “  ”

is clearly required; but why put a comma after “easier”?
                   ;                           “      ”?




  18A. It belongs in the lower, or, as it would be better to call it,
     .                        ,   ,                                 ,

  the easier, grades of work.
            ,               .




The comma after “easier” acts with the comma before “or” to suspend
                “      ”                            “  ”           

what comes between “lower” and “grades,” just as a similar group of
                   “     ”     “      ,”                           

words is suspended in Sentence 3-1.
                                - .







OR and AND
          




The relations expressed by “or” and “and” are so nearly identical that
                           “  ”     “   ”                             

every rule or principle of punctuation requiring a mark before one
                                                                  

of them requires it before the other in similarly formed sentences.
                                                                  .

Only an occasional use of “and” expresses a shade of meaning like that
                          “   ”                                       

expressed by “or” in the above sentences. For this reason it may be
             “  ”                       .                          

well to caution the student against the common error of using a comma
                                                                     

before “and” in a sentence formed like No. 18A, but not like it in
       “   ”                             .    ,                   

meaning:
       :




  18A-1. We are not willing to give our sanction to the broad and, when
     - .                                                         ,     

  applied in a case like that at bar, harsh rule of instruction.
                                    ,                          .







APPOSITIVES
           




A class of words called “appositives” falls under the classification
                        “           ”                               

and reasoning we have been considering; and an example or two will
                                      ;                           

suffice to show this:
                    :




  19. The word, eagle, is derived from the Latin.
    .         ,      ,                          .




  19-1. The word _eagle_ is derived from the Latin.
    - .                                           .




In No. 19 “eagle” is used to explain what word, and might very properly
     .    “     ”                             ,                        

go into the class of words that we have called purely parenthetical. It
                                                                   .   

seems to be more closely allied to the class of appositives, and thus
                                                           ,         

takes a grammatical relation which makes it slightly parenthetical, or
                                                                  ,   

explanatory.
           .




In No. 19 “word” is the subject of the sentence; “eagle” shows with
     .    “    ”                               ; “     ”           

what “word” we are dealing. In No. 19-1 “word” is adjectival in
     “    ”               .      .   -  “    ”                 

meaning, and can no more take a comma than can “good” in “good man.”
       ,                                       “    ”    “        .”

“Eagle,” as a word, is the subject of the sentence.
“     ,”          ,                               .




  19-2. His son John did all the work on the farm.
    - .                                          .




  19-3. His son, John, did all the work on the farm.
    - .        ,     ,                             .




In No. 19-2 we are told that _one_ of his sons, named “John,” did the
     .   -                                    ,       “    ,”        

work. In No. 19-3 we are told that his son, not his daughter nor _one_
    .      .   -                          ,                           

of his sons, did the work. “John” is simply explanatory, as is “who is
           ,             . “    ”                      ,       “      

at home” in No. 14-3.
       ”      .   - .




In Nos. 19 and 19-3 we have language that expresses a different meaning
      .          -                                                     

from that expressed in Nos. 19-1 and 19-2; and therefore we use the
                          .   -        - ;                         

commas to show that the _apparent_ meaning of the two former sentences
                                                                      

is not the _real_ meaning of the two latter.
                                           .







VOCATIVES
         




Likewise the so-called vocatives, or words of address, come, though
               -                ,                    ,     ,       

somewhat indirectly, under this same classification and reasoning:
                   ,                                             :




  19B. Ring out, wild bells.
     .         ,           .




If expressed in full, the sentence would read as follows:
                    ,                                   :




  19B-1. Ring ye, wild bells, out.
     - .        ,           ,    .




Here “wild bells” is merely an appositive of the subject, “ye,” which
     “          ”                                       , “  ,”      

is understood in No. 19B.
                   .    .

  Why do we use commas in No. 25-1, and not in No. 25? In No. 25,

  What difference in meaning does the difference in punctuation give in

  No. 28 says the meal was a _royal_ one. The word _supped_ is added,

  The punctuation is correct in each example; but the mode of

CHAPTER IV
          




GROUPING DONE BY THE SEMICOLON AND THE COLON
                                            







Thus far in our discussion we have considered grouping done by commas
                                                                     

only, except incidentally in Sentences 6, 6-2, 7, 7-1, and 7-2. We
    ,                                   ,  - ,  ,  - ,      - .   

shall now consider the application of our fundamental principle to
                                                                  

grouping that requires the semicolon and the colon.
                                                  .




Our first illustrative sentence (No. 20) is from a distinguished
                                (  .   )                        

writer, noted for the “infinite care he gives to his diction.” We think
      ,               “                                     .”         

the sentence decidedly distracting:
                                  :




  20. I have an arrangement to do a serial for Harper’s, and a series
    .                                                ’ ,             

  of wayside pieces for Scribner’s, Smith illustrating, is on the tapis.
                                ’ ,                   ,                .




Probably very few persons, in reading the above sentence at sight,
                         ,                                       ,

would take notice from the first comma that the sentence is here
                                                                

divided into two shorter sentences (the grammarians call these
                                   (                          

sentence-parts _clauses_). In the absence of such notice, the reader
        -               ).                              ,           

goes on to “is” before discovering the real relation of the group of
           “  ”                                                     

words following “and.” The comma before “and” does not clearly show
                “   .”                  “   ”                      

that “and” connects the two larger groups of the sentence, and so gives
     “   ”                                               ,             

notice to the reader that the first group, which is one of the clauses,
                                         ,                            ,

is complete; nor, in the absence of such notice, is the reader told
           ;    ,                              ,                   

that the words immediately following “and” look forward, instead of
                                     “   ”             ,           

backward, for their completion as a group.
        ,                                .




The confusion or uncertainty of grouping is here further increased by
                                                                     

the character of the two groups between which “and” appears to stand.
                                              “   ”                 .

Each begins with the same word (a), thus making them appear to be
                               ( ),                              

coördinate groups; and each group appears to be the object of “do.”
                 ;                                            “  .”




Perhaps the author would contend that the comma before “and” is
                                                       “   ”   

sufficient to give notice of the proper grouping, just as we used a
                                                ,                  

comma for a somewhat similar grouping in Sentence 1-1. Such contention
                                                   - .                

would not be without merit; but Sentence 1-1 is much shorter, and
                          ;               -                 ,    

the consequent liability to make the wrong grouping is much less.
                                                                .

Our discussion might thus end in a difference of opinion without
                                                                

determining the degree of separation requiring a mark of higher rank
                                                                    

than the comma. The discussion could be opened by an admission on our
              .                                                      

part that a semicolon in No. 1-1 would be better than the comma; for
                           .  -                                ;    

its warning of the change of grouping would be unmistakable by any
                                                                  

reader.
      .




Two reasons may be given for the use of the comma in No. 1-1, instead
                                                       .  - ,        

of the semicolon; and we give them in order to emphasize the fact that
                ;                                                     

we cannot always have in language one degree of separation that calls
                                                                     

unmistakably for the comma, and another degree that calls unmistakably
                          ,                                           

for the semicolon. The reasons for the use of the comma in No. 1-1 are
                 .                                           .  -     

as follows:
          :




1. As the sentence is very short, the eye readily catches the relation
 .                              ,                                     

requiring the grouping that carries “their mothers” forward for its
                                    “             ”                

connection, instead of backward to “children.”

2. The use of a semicolon in this sentence might seem to justify a rule
 .                                                                     

requiring a semicolon in every sentence composed of two clauses, while
                                                               ,      

convention hardly justifies such punctuation. On the other hand, if we
                                            .                  ,      

prefer the use of the semicolon in No. 1-1, under what conditions would
                                     .  - ,                            

the comma be preferred? If what immediately follows the conjunction
                      ?                                            

between any two clauses, especially short ones, does not suggest
                       ,                      ,                 

connection with what precedes, a comma before the conjunction gives
                             ,                                     

sufficient notice of the grouping of the language into two clauses.
                                                                  .




Thus we have forced upon us, at least apparently, the necessity of
                           ,                    ,                 

making choice in many sentences between the comma and the semicolon.
                                                                   .

The problem is further complicated by the need of the different classes
                                                                       

of readers for whom the marks in language are used, and still further
                                                  ,                  

by convention.
             .




The proper punctuation of No. 20 is as follows:
                            .                 :

Our next sentence is particularly interesting because of its character

In No. 20-1 we use a semicolon expressly to show that what immediately
     .   -                                                            

follows the mark looks forward for its connection; and, it seems to
                                                 ;    ,            

us, the semicolon in No. 21 cannot fail to give to any reader, with
  ,                    .                                     ,     

or without much knowledge of marks, notice that a complete new group,
                                  ,                                 ,

and not an additional part of the preceding group, is to follow the
                                                 ,                 

semicolon. If the reader is looking forward for a new group (a clause),
         .                                                  (        ),

the ending of the sentence gives him a surprise, and compels him to
                                               ,                   

read over the entire sentence to make the proper grouping.
                                                         .




It is difficult to say just what notice a comma before “and” in
                                                       “   ”   

Sentence 21 would give most readers. Let us so punctuate it, and
                                   .                       ,    

challenge the comma. What will its answer be? This, of course, is a
                   .                        ?     ,          ,     

question that the reader puts to himself, testing his own knowledge
                                        ,                          

of the marks. In the light of our discussion of Sentence 1, the comma
            .                                             ,          

might seem to say that “and” does not connect “writings” with some
                       “   ”                  “        ”          

noun to follow. We shall see, later in our discussion, that a comma
              .             ,                        ,             

may be necessary in a grouping almost like this; but in this sentence
                                               ;                     

the reader has another aid, in fact two others, thus making the comma
                          ,                   ,                      

unnecessary, if not objectionable. The word “equally,” which comes
           ,                     .          “       ,”            

before “in his scientific writings,” raises the expectation of a
       “                          ,”                            

similar group to follow and to be introduced by a suitable connecting
                                                                     

word. As “and” is such a word, the absence of a mark of punctuation
    .    “   ”               ,                                     

before it at once suggests that a like group is to follow. The second
                                                         .           

aid to the reader in the process of grouping is the word “in,” which
                                                         “  ,”      

introduces each of the groups connected by “and,” and identifies the
                                           “   ,”                   

second group as the coördinate of the first.
                                           .







We punctuate to aid the reader quickly to grasp _through the eye_ the
                                                                     

groupings of printed language, and to enable him to determine the
                             ,                                   

relations between the groups thus formed. When a mark is not needed for
                                        .                              

this purpose, it may be omitted.
            ,                  .







If we say _the man is in a bad state of mind and in an equally bad
                                                                  

state of body_, the eye catches the words “and” and “in,” at the end
              ,                           “   ”     “  ,”           

of the line, practically at the same instant. The “in” tells of the
           ,                                .     “  ”             

grouping so distinctly that a comma is not needed to inform the reader
                                                                      

that no word follows “and” to be connected by it to “mind.” Therefore
                     “   ”                          “    .”          

we say, when groups are so similarly formed that the word following the
      ,                                                                

conjunction gives ample notice of the grouping, a comma is not needed.
                                              ,                      .

We shall consider this point more fully in another place.
                                                        .




By a slight change in the wording of No. 21, we get a counterpart of
                                       .   ,                        

the illustrative grouping just given:
                                    :




  21-1. He displayed good judgment in his scientific writings and in
    - .                                                             

  his public documents.
                      .




The grouping here is so unmistakable as to make a comma before “and”
                                                               “   ”

quite objectionable. It is unmistakable because of the like formation
                   .                                                 

of the groups, and also because of the absence of any word after “and”
             ,                                                   “   ”

that suggests a wrong relation to what precedes.
                                               .




Now, if we do introduce a word or two between “and” and “in,” and such
   ,                                          “   ”     “  ,”         

words do not suggest relation to what precedes, we may still omit the
                                              ,                      

comma before “and.” This reasoning, with that above, suggests the best
             “   .”               ,                ,                  

punctuation of No. 21, which is as follows:
                 .   ,                    :




  21-2. The deliberate good sense with which Franklin treated
    - .                                                      

  matters of religion and morality, he displayed equally in his
                                  ,                            

  scientific writings and, a little later, in his public documents and
                         ,               ,                            

  correspondence, which made him as eminent in diplomacy and statecraft
                ,                                                      

  as he had earlier been in science and local affairs.
                                                     .




Thus we find no need of any mark before “and” in this sentence, where a
                                        “   ”                 ,        

painstaking writer uses a semicolon.
                                   .




As “and,” even in No. 21-1, does not connect “writings” with
   “   ,”           .   - ,                  “        ”     

“documents,” but connects the two groups of words beginning with “in,”
“         ,”                                                     “  ,”

the adjective clause in No. 21-2 beginning with “which” can hardly go
                          .   -                 “     ”              

over into the first group, and there find a noun which it may seem to
                         ,                                           

modify.
      .







To illustrate how puzzling a rule may be, and how wrong, we quote the
                                        ,              ,             

following rule from Mr. Wilson’s work (page 113):
                      .       ’       (        ):




_When a sentence consists of three or more clauses, united by a
                                                  ,            

conjunction, none of which are susceptible of division, a semicolon
           ,                                          ,            

should be put between those_ _which are least connected in sense, and
                                                                ,    

a comma only between the others._
                               . 




To illustrate this rule, the following sentence is given in Mr.
                       ,                                      .

    .                        ,                                        ;

  _for_ it has been felt by a poet, _and_ we can feel for ever[5] what

  he felt.
         .




Does the punctuation indicate the real sense relations in this
                                                              

sentence? We think not. The semicolon before “for” divides the sentence
        ?             .                      “   ”                     

into two parts; but what follows the semicolon is clearly not in the
              ;                                                     

_for_ relation with all that precedes it, as it should be if the
                                        ,                       

sentence is divided into two parts at this point. The sense relation
                                                .                   

expressed by “for” is unmistakably between all that follows it and what
             “   ”                                                     

precedes it back to “but.”
                    “   .”




The real division of the sentence into two parts is made at “but,” as
                                                            “   ,”   

shown in the following:
                      :




  22-1. The woods may disappear, but the spirit of them never will now.
    - .                        ,                                      .




Expanding the above, to emphasize the relations, but still maintaining
                   ,                           ,                      

the sense of No. 22, we get the following:
               .   ,                     :




  22-2. The woods may disappear, for they are material and will decay;
    - .                        ,                                     ;

  but the spirit of them never will now, for it has been felt by a poet
                                       ,                               

  and we can feel forever what he felt.
                                      .




In No. 22-2 we added a commonplace modifier to the first statement in
     .   -                                                           

the sentence, in order to exhibit more clearly the similar relation
            ,                                                      

between two like groups in the second part of the sentence, which take
                                                          ,           

a semicolon in the quoted sentence (No. 22).
                                   (  .   ).




Punctuated so as to show the real sense relations, the sentence reads
                                                 ,                   

as follows:
          :




  22-3. The woods may disappear: but the spirit of them never will now;
    - .                        :                                      ;

  for it has been felt by a poet, and we can feel forever what he felt.
                                ,                                     .




A thorough comprehension of the groupings in these sentences, which
                                                            ,      

is based upon sense relations, will illuminate the punctuation
                             ,                                

already discussed. It will also explain some apparent, if not real,
                 .                                   ,            ,

inconsistencies that are inevitable in dealing with marks to express
                                                                    

indefinite degrees of relation.
                              .




Sentence 1 is composed of two clauses connected by a conjunction, as
                                                                ,   

is also Sentence 22-1. The liability to error in grouping Sentence 1
                   - .                                              

may be sufficient to require a semicolon; but the grouping in Sentence
                                        ;                             

22-1 is so unmistakable that a comma is sufficient to give notice of a
  -                                                                   

change in the direction of the thought. In Sentence 21 the semicolon
                                      .                             

gives notice of a grouping which does not follow. In Sentence 22 the
                                                .                   

grouping by punctuation does not follow the meaning of the language,
                                                                   ,

and is therefore wrong.
                      .




Wrong grouping is perhaps most common in sentences containing groups
                                                                    

requiring coördinate conjunctions, such as “and” and “but.” Quite often
                                 ,         “   ”     “   .”            

such sentences cannot be so punctuated as to show the correct grouping
                                                                      

by the marks. The following sentence is an example:
            .                                     :




  23. The Society has expelled two of its members for unprofessional
    .                                                               

  conduct, and has investigated complaints against two other members,
         ,                                                          ,

  but it has been unable to obtain enough evidence to convict them.
                                                                  .




This is not bad punctuation, for it conveys the meaning, which,
                           ,                           ,      ,

however, is not difficult to obtain; but it is not good punctuation,
       ,                           ;                               ,

for the marks do not group the words in accordance with the sense
                                                                 

relations that exist between the groups.
                                       .




If the sentence were divided into two parts by “but,” the _but_
                                               “   ,”          

relation would exist between what follows and _each_ of the groups
                                                                  

of words coördinated by the conjunction “and.” Thus we would say,
                                        “   .”                  ,

“The Society has expelled four of its members for unprofessional
“                                                               

conduct, but _has been unable to obtain enough evidence to convict
       ,                                                          

them_.” As this relation does not make sense, we know that the “but”
     .”                                     ,                  “   ”

relation exists between what follows it and what precedes it back to
                                                                    

“and.” As the _but_ relation does not extend beyond “and,” this fact
“   .”                                              “   ,”          

should be shown by the mark, thus requiring a larger mark (semicolon)
                           ,                              (         )

before “and.” But a semicolon before “and” would separate two closely
       “   .”                        “   ”                           

connected groups (predicates),—“has expelled” and “has investigated.”
                 (          ),—“            ”     “                .”

It would also connect the second group with the third, making one
                                                     ,           

larger group in the _and_ relation with the first.
                                                 .




As the sense relations here require a grouping inconsistent with the
                                                                    

grammatical relations, a change in the language becomes necessary
                     ,                                           

before it can be properly punctuated:
                                    :




  23-1. The Society has expelled two of its members for unprofessional
    - .                                                               

  conduct; and _it_ has investigated complaints against two other
         ;                                                       

  members, but has been unable to obtain enough evidence to convict
         ,                                                         

  them.
      .




The insertion of “it” (a new subject) after “and,” and its omission
                 “  ” (             )       “   ,”                 

after “but,” with the proper use of the semicolon, make clear the two
      “   ,”                                     ,                   

things done by the Society, and make this clear by the proper grouping
                          ,                                           

of words to show the unmistakable thought-grouping.
                                         -        .




If we are required to punctuate language which we are not permitted to
                                                                      

change, our punctuation may have to depart from our system, whether
      ,                                                   ,        

established by rule or by reason. A study of such punctuation will
                                .                                 

lead to a nice discrimination in both marks and relations. Our next
                                                         .         

sentence, with its different modes of punctuation, will illustrate the
        ,                                        ,                    

point. The sentence is given in three forms: (1) as it appeared in a
     .                                     : ( )                    

literary journal; (2) as it is printed in the Common Version of the New
                ; ( )                                                  

Testament (2 Timothy i, 16); and (3) as it is printed in the Revised
          (           ,   );     ( )                                

Version. We shall, however, not follow its division into two verses, as
       .         ,        ,                                        ,   

it appears in the Common Version of the Bible:
                                             :




  24. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
    .                                                  ;

      ,                            ,             .

  refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but, when he was in
              ,                                :    ,

      ,                                 ,             .




  24-2. The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft

  refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; but, when he was in
              ,                                ;    ,               

  Rome, he sought me out diligently, and found me.
      ,                            ,             .




In each of these three sentences the punctuation divides the language
                                                                     

into three larger groups of words, two of which are subdivided by
                                 ,                               

commas. In the second and third a colon indicates a second grouping
      .                                                            

of each sentence into two main parts, but not at the same point. If
                                    ,                          .   

the semicolons and the colons were challenged for their meanings, the
                                                                ,    

answers would show an interesting variety of grouping of words, as
                                                              ,   

well as a variety of sense relations. Such a variety of punctuation is
                                    .                                 

common only because the actual significance of marks, in their grouping
                                                    ,                  

and relational effects, has not been considered.
                      ,                        .




These sentences present the same problem, though somewhat further
                                        ,                        

complicated, that was presented by Nos. 22 and 23. We have only to
           ,                          .          .                

ask ourselves how far the _but_, _for_, and _and_ relations extend.
                               ,      ,                           .

Do the marks so group the words as to indicate the sense relations by
                                                                     

the grouping? Of course they do not, as is shown by the difference in
            ?                      ,                                 

the groupings. In No. 24 neither semicolon shows how far the _for_ or
             .      .                                                

the _but_ relation extends; and therefore neither mark is an efficient
                          ;                                           

sign-board. If challenged for a meaning, neither could give the reader
    -     .                            ,                              

an intelligent answer.
                     .




In each of Nos. 24-1 and 24-2 the colon makes another grouping,
              .   -        -                                  ,

dividing each sentence into two still larger groups. Here each mark
                                                   .               

would give a definite answer to a challenge; but both answers could not
                                           ;                           

be correct. The sentence is unmistakably divided into two parts, the
          .                                                    ,    

first part ending with “Onesiphorus.” Mercy is sought for him because
                       “           .”                                

of what he did; and what he did is specified in the language that
              ;                                                  

follows “for.” The extent of the _for_ relation, therefore, must be
        “   .”                                 ,          ,        

shown by the mark. A colon will clearly show that it goes to the end of
                 .                                                     

the sentence, as a like relation was shown by the colon in No. 6-2.
            ,                                                .  - .




We now have to deal with the proper grouping of all that follows “for”;
                                                                 “   ”;

but we cannot use a colon for this purpose because, having been used
                                                  ,                 

once, a second colon in the same sentence would confuse the whole
    ,                                                            

grouping. We thus come to a serious difficulty, which arises out of the
        .                                     ,                        

number of groups to be made with the marks (comma and semicolon) left
                                           (                   )     

at our disposal. This difficulty would be even greater in No. 24-2 had
               .                                            .   -     

we quoted the sentence in full, the complete verse containing another
                              ,                                      

clause. In the second of the two larger groups we have an _and_ and
      .                                                            

a _but_ relation exactly like the _and_ and _but_ relations in No.
                                                                 .

23, which we could not indicate by marks. As we may not change the
  ,                                     .                         

language of the sentence under consideration, we must punctuate it with
                                            ,                          

as little violence to the meanings of marks as possible. Probably the
                                                       .             

clearest punctuation of the sentence would be as follows:
                                                        :




  24-3. The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
    - .                                                   ;           

  refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, but, when he was in
              ,                                ,    ,               

  Rome, he sought me very diligently, and found me.
      ,                             ,             .




As the sentence is thus divided into two main parts, with only commas
                                                   ,                 

in one part, the semicolon is sufficient to mark the larger groups. As
           ,                                                      .   

the comma before “but” does not suggest to the reader how far back the
                 “   ”                                                

_but_ relation extends, he is left to ascertain it without the aid of a
                      ,                                                

mark definitely pointing it out.
                               .




We do not claim this to be good punctuation, but we think it the best
                                           ,                         

the sentence will permit. The sentence seems to show the fault of bad
                        .                                            

grouping.
        .




If we are ever in doubt as to how far back a relation, indicated or to
                                                     ,                

be indicated by a mark before the conjunction, extends, we can easily
                                             ,        ,              

determine this by forming the relation between the words _apparently_
                                                                     

thus connected. Take, for instance, Sentence 24. The _for_ relation
              .     ,             ,            .                   

between “give mercy” and “was not ashamed” is just as evident as the
        “          ”     “               ”                          

_for_ relation between “give mercy” and “he oft refreshed me.” We can
                       “          ”     “                   .”       

say “give mercy, for he oft refreshed me” and “give mercy, for he was
    “          ,                        ”     “          ,           

not ashamed.”
           .”




Let us attempt to make a like grouping to determine how far back the
                                                                    

_but_ relation extends. It appears to extend to the two preceding
                      .                                          

groups, which, being connected by “and” and put between two semicolons,
      ,      ,                    “   ”                               ,

constitute one group. This would give us “was not ashamed, but sought
                    .                    “               ,           

me” and[6] “refreshed me, but sought me.” The sense, of course, shows
  ”    [ ] “            ,              .”          ,          ,      

that the second group is not a proper group.
                                           .




A writer, as we shall see later, should always guard against using
        ,                      ,                                  

a conjunction between words or groups of words not bearing to each
                                                                  

other the relation indicated by such conjunction. Much confusion in
                                                .                  

punctuation arises from an effort to indicate by the use of marks
                                                                 

relations that are not sense relations, as in the sentences just
                                      ,                         

considered.
          .







A somewhat different, but even more effective, grouping is shown
                    ,                        ,                  

by another use of the colon; but, very singularly, practically all
                           ;    ,                ,                

writers on punctuation seem to ignore this use. Before considering it,
                                              .                      ,

we shall take up the colon’s conventional use, which is that of the
                          ’                  ,                     

“formal” introduction of any matter, such as particulars, a speech, or
“      ”                           ,                    ,         ,   

a quotation:
           :




  25. I purchased the following articles: one dozen pens, one ream of
    .                                   :               ,            

  paper, and one box of envelopes.
       ,                         .




  25-1. The speaker arose, and addressed the audience as follows:
    - .                  ,                                      :




  “The occasion which brings us together,” etc.
  “                                     ,”    .




  25-2. The speaker said: “The occasion which brings us together,” etc.
    - .                 : “                                     ,”    .




It is difficult to find a reason for this use of the colon, inasmuch
                                                          ,         

as what follows the colon in any of the above sentences, is not a
                                                       ,         

“limb” of the sentence. The relation in No. 25 is clearly that of
“    ”                .                   .                      

apposition; and it is the same in Nos. 25-1 and 25-2. In the latter the
          ;                          .   -        - .                  

apposition is between some word not expressed, but understood, and what
                                             ,               ,         

follows,—for example, “addressed the audience _in language_ such as
       ,—           , “                                            

follows,” “the speaker said _these things_.”
       ,” “                               .”







We have called this the “conventional” use because it has become the
                        “            ”                              

accepted punctuation. We introduce it here in order to show that this
                    .                                                

same relation (apposition) governs in a frequent use of this mark which
              (          )                                             

is not explained by the writers on punctuation.
                                              .




Before passing to this use of the colon, let us make sure that the
                                       ,                          

meaning of “formal introduction” is quite clear to us. It means that
           “                   ”                     .              

the matter following the colon is announced or suggested in a manner
                                                                    

somewhat similar to the announcement made in the words _viz._, _as
                                                           . ,    

follows_, etc. It thus implies that the matter is introduced according
        ,    .                                                        

to a _form_. “He said,” followed by a colon, is one of the usual
           . “       ,”                    ,                    

conventional forms; but _he said that_ is not so considered, and no
                  ;                                        ,       

mark at all follows “said.”
                    “    .”




We use a colon throughout this work at the end of the line preceding an
                                                                       

example if the example illustrates what precedes. This use of the colon
                                                .                      

ties the example to what _precedes_. See the colon preceding Sentence
                                   .                                 

25, above.
  ,      .




It is also to be noted that the colon loses, in this formal and
                                           ,                   

conventional use, its _relative_ value, that is, its rank above the
                ,                     ,        ,                   

comma and the semicolon. Thus it often appears in only one or in both
                       .                                             

of the semicolon-divided groups of a sentence:
                -                            :




  25-3. In a bill of exchange there are three original parties: drawer,
    - .                                                       :       ,

  drawee, and payee; in a promissory note, only two parties: the maker
        ,          ;                     ,                 :          

  and the payee.
               .




Here we see that the colons are used to group each one of the two parts
                                                                       

into which the sentence is divided by a _semicolon_. We shall show
                                                   .              

later (Sentence 33) what we consider a much better mode of punctuating
      (           )                                                   

such sentences, and thus avoiding the appearance of making the colon
              ,                                                     

subordinate to the semicolon.
                            .




We are here seeking to exhibit the relation of apposition. When words
                                                         .           

or groups of words stand in this relation, the second word or group
                                         ,                         

expresses in another form what is expressed in the first word or group
                                                                      

of words. In No. 25 what follows the colon is the same as “articles,”
        .      .                                          “        ,”

which precedes it. If the word “articles” were omitted, the colon would
                 .             “        ”             ,                

still be used, “articles” or a like word being understood, as some word
             , “        ”                                ,             

is understood in Nos. 25-1 and 25-2. The same relation is shown in
                    .   -        - .                              

Sentence 32-2 by means of parentheses.
           -                         .




With this understanding of the relation between groups separated by the
                                                                       

colon, our next illustrative sentence is particularly interesting,
     ,                                                           ,

not only because of its character, but because of its source. As
                                 ,                          .   

punctuated, it fails to show a nice meaning in language which is quite
          ,                                                           

easily overlooked in the absence of the proper distinguishing mark;
                                                                  ;

and it is from a letter by Thomas Bailey Aldrich in reply to one, from
                                                                ,     

a friend, which he could not decipher. It appears in the foremost
        ,                            .

subject of punctuation:
                      :




  26. There is a singular and a perpetual charm in a letter of yours;
    .                                                               ;

  it never grows old; it never loses its novelty.
                    ;                           .




The use of two semicolons, dividing this sentence into three clauses,
                         ,                                          ,

signifies that these clauses are in like relation to each other,—that
                                                               ,—    

is, that they are coördinate in sense. If the _and_ or the _or_
  ,                                  .                         

relation exists between the first and second clauses, it must exist
                                                    ,              

between the second and third, just as it exists between the three items
                            ,                                          

named in the second part of No. 25.
                              .   .




A very slight examination of the meaning of the language of this
                                                                

sentence shows that the clauses are not coördinate in sense, although
                                                           ,         

such coordination is indicated by the use of the same mark between them.
                                                                       .




The relation between the second and third clauses is exhibited in the
                                                                     

following:
         :




  26-1. It never grows old; and it never loses its novelty.
    - .                   ;                               .




We cannot unite the first and second clauses in this way, and retain
                                                        ,           

the real meaning of the language; nor have we, thus far in our study,
                                ;            ,                      ,

found a meaning of the semicolon that would give the reader notice of
                                                                     

the relation between the first clause of No. 26 and what follows. The
                                           .                    .    

second and third clauses of this sentence are as plainly explanatory
                                                                    

of the first clause as are the items that follow the colon in No. 25
                                                                .   

explanatory of “articles.” A change in the wording of the sentence will
               “        .”                                             

show that it is exactly similar in its relation to No. 25:
                                                     .   :




  26-2. Your letter possesses the following singular and perpetual
    - .                                                           

  charms: youthfulness and novelty.
        :                         .




If this relation exists between the principal thought and the detailed
                                                                      

items, then we may indicate it by the colon, thus dividing the sentence
     ,                                     ,                           

into two groups with the relation of apposition between them:
                                                            :




  26-3. There is a singular and a perpetual charm in a letter of yours:
    - .                                                               :

  it never grows old; it never loses its novelty.
                    ;                           .




Let us note how carefully language is used in this sentence: the
                                                           :    

letter possesses a _singular_ charm (it never loses its novelty) and a
                                    (                          )      

_perpetual_ charm (it never grows old).
                  (                  ).




The colon both groups the language and shows the relation (apposition)
                                                          (          )

between the two main groups. On the other hand, the semicolon in this
                           .                  ,                      

sentence stands where the sense relation is the _and_ relation.
                                                              .




It is not quite proper to say that the second and third clauses are
                                                                   

explanatory simply of “charm”: they are explanatory of the entire first
                      “     ”:                                         

clause, repeating and expanding the thought expressed in that clause,
      ,                                                             ,

just as what follows the colon in the sentence we are writing explains
                                                                      

what precedes.
             .







Our next illustrative sentence is from one of Howell’s novels, which
                                                    ’        ,      

was printed at The Riverside Press. It has the fault of No. 26, and
                                  .                       .   ,    

the added fault of an indefinite _but_ relation:
                                               :




  27. He was not candid; he did not shun concealments and evasions; but
    .                  ;                                          ;    

  positive lies he had kept from.
                                .




The second clause is clearly explanatory of the first; and the
                                                     ;        

third clause simply modifies the second by showing the degree of
                                                                

untruthfulness of the man.
                         .




With the new meaning of the colon we are now considering, a colon after
                                                        ,              

“candid” informs the reader of the relation between the main groups of
“      ”                                                              

the sentence:
            :




  27-1. He was not candid: he did not shun concealments and evasions;
    - .                  :                                          ;

  but positive lies he had kept from.
                                    .




So far as the mere grouping is concerned, this could be done in Nos. 26
                                        ,                          .   

and 27 by a semicolon and a comma in each; but the semicolon would not
                                         ;                            

inform the reader of the true relation between the two larger groups.
                                                                    .

The colon would still be required if the next two groups took a comma,
                                                                     ,

or even no mark, between them.
               ,             .




We called this relation that of apposition. We might say, somewhat more
                                          .             ,              

specifically, that the second group is an amplification in language to
            ,                                                         

express an extension of the idea, or to fortify the image, of the first
                                ,                        ,             

group. This purpose may also be accomplished by a contrast between the
     .                                                                

ideas expressed in the two groups.
                                 .




The writer on punctuation who says, as do many such writers, that the
                                  ,                        ,         

colon is an obsolete mark, except in its formal use for enumeration,
                         ,                                         ,

does so, we believe, in ignorance of the useful and beautiful purpose
       ,           ,                                                 

it performs in a very large class of sentences.
                                              .

  This sentence, from a well-known writer, is poorly punctuated, and
               ,            -            ,                     ,

  The omission of a comma before the first “or” is proper; the use of

  one before each following “or” is unnecessary.

  “A fine thing” and “a foolish thing” are general terms, and are
  “            ”     “               ”                  ,        

  followed by four illustrations in alternative groups,—for instance,

  “an encouragement to friendliness” is “a fine thing,” and “a tribute

  to fashion” is “a foolish thing.” This sense relation requires a

  “According to the spirit and the form which it takes” belongs to

  each semicolon group following the colon; and, moreover, it is a

  mere duplication in sense of “as the case may be.” It is difficult,
                               “                  .”                ,

  groups, where it seems to belong.

  The substitution of “according to the spirit and the form it takes”
                      “                                             ”

  for “as the case may be,” would convey, it seems to us, the author’s

  The sense relations between the three clauses of the above sentence

                                                        ,         ,   

  follows:
         :




  1. Writing carelessly.
   .                   .




  2. Spelling names differently.
   .                           .




  3. Forming letters obscurely.
   .                          .




  4. Possessing, or observing, no system in the use of capitals,
   .           ,             ,                                 ,

  italics, and marks of punctuation.
         ,                         .




  If these four faults form a series, what does “writing carelessly”
                                    ,           “                  ”

  mean? To spell a word in different ways, to form letters obscurely,
      ?                                  ,                          ,

  or to observe no system in the use of capitals, etc., is “writing
                                                ,    .,    “       

  carelessly.” In short, the first term of the four is a general
            .”         ,                                        

  statement, of which the three terms that follow are details. This
           ,                                                 .     

  fact should be shown by the punctuation.
                                         .




  A colon after the first clause will show its relation to what follows.
                                                                       .













CHAPTER V
         




SOME USES OF THE DASH
                     







It is often said that the dash is the mark of ignorance in punctuation.
                                                                      .

When a writer does not know how to punctuate his own language at
                                                                

any point he uses a dash. When one, in the preparation of another’s
                        .         ,                              ’ 

manuscript for the printer, cannot exactly make out the meaning at
                          ,                                       

any point, and therefore does not know what mark to use, he inserts a
         ,                                             ,             

dash. When the printer, who does most of the world’s punctuation, is in
    .                 ,                           ’             ,      

doubt, he uses a dash.
     ,               .




Out of this mass of hit-or-miss punctuation, many writers of text-books
                       -  -                ,                     -     

on punctuation have attempted to formulate rules for the use of the
                                                                   

dash. The result is—“all that could be expected.”
    .              —“                          .”




The dash is a useful mark. It came late into our language; and it came
                         .                               ;            

to meet a real need, which our illustrative sentences and discussions,
                   ,                                                 ,

we hope, will reveal.
       ,            .




One of the distinctive uses of the dash is to indicate a rhetorical
                                                                   

pause made by a speaker for a specific and well-understood purpose. Mr.
                                               -                  .   .

De Vinne says “the dash should be selected whenever there is an abrupt
              “                                                       

change in a statement.” This is the primary use of the mark, and is
                     .”                                    ,       

the one generally understood by persons with even a slight knowledge
                                                                    

of punctuation. Mr. De Vinne illustrates his definition by a sentence
              .   .                                                  

which possesses special interest for the student of punctuation. This
                                                               .     

sentence appears also in the works of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bigelow,
                                        .              .        ,

and in several other text-books on punctuation. As Mr. Wilson’s work
                         -                    .      .       ’      

antedates all the others, it is probable that he first used the
                        ,                                      

sentence.
        .




As Mr. Bigelow and Mr. De Vinne made changes, even though slight, in
     .               .                      ,                   ,   

the sentence, its study becomes both interesting and informing. We give
            ,                                                 .        

the sentence as written by each of these writers:
                                                :




  28. HERE LIES THE GREAT—False marble! where? Nothing but
    .                    —            !      ?            

  sordid dust lies here.—Wilson.
                       .—      .




  28-1. Here lies the great— False marble! where? Nothing but sordid
    - .                    —             !      ?                   

  dust lies here.—Bigelow.
                .—       .




  28-2. Here lies the great—false marble! where? Nothing but sordid
    - .                    —            !      ?                   

  dust lies here.—De Vinne.
                .—        .




Let us carefully compare these examples, and ask the meanings of the
                                       ,                            

different modes of printing them.
                                .




In No. 28 the first four words are in small-capital letters, the first
     .                                     -               ,          

word of the sentence beginning, of course, with a capital. The word
                              ,          ,               .         

“false” begins with a capital.
“     ”                      .




In No. 28-1 there are no small-capital letters, and there is a space
     .   -                    -               ,                     

after the dash.
              .




In 28-2 “false” begins with a small letter.
     -  “     ”                           .




We are not particularly concerned with the second part of the example
                                                                     

(nothing but sordid dust lies here).
(                                 ).




What is the meaning of the small-capital letters in No. 28?
                                -                     .   ?




What is the meaning of the space following the dash in No. 28-1?
                                                         .   - ?




What is the meaning of the capital letter beginning “false” in Nos. 28
                                                    “     ”       .   

and 28-1, and of the small letter beginning the same word in No. 28-2?
      - ,                                                      .   - ?




What punctuation will best reveal the full meaning of this sentence, so
                                                                   ,   

differently treated by these well-known writers?
                                 -             ?




We venture to assert that few readers would grasp at the first reading
                                                                      

the _real_ relations in this sentence, and, further, that not a few
                                     ,    ,        ,               

cultured readers would make bad work of the sense in reading No. 28-2
                                                               .   - 

at sight.
        .




Mr. Wilson makes no explanation of his use of the small-capital
  .                                                    -       

letters; and their absence from Nos. 28-1 and 28-2 imply that Mr.
       ;                           .   -        -               .

Bigelow and Mr. De Vinne attached no importance to them. We think they
              .                                        .

              ,                        ,        ;                

little imagination to picture the scene which this typographical device
                                                                       

suggests. Let us imagine it, and learn one important use of the dash.
        .                  ,                                        .




On an anniversary day, a crowd stands before the monument of a great
                     ,                                              

man. Let us assume it to be a monument of Shakespeare. The speaker is
   .                                                 .               

in the midst of his oration, his listeners “hanging” on his words. He
                           ,               “       ”             .   

turns to the statue, and, with pointing finger, directs the attention
                   ,    ,                     ,                      

of his hearers to the inscription on the base of the monument, which
                                                             ,      

inscription reads as follows:
                            :




  HERE LIES THE GREAT SHAKESPEARE
                                 




The orator begins slowly to read the inscription. When he reaches the
                                                .                    

name of the great man, he hesitates, turns his attention from the
                     ,             ,                             

inscription to the monument as a whole, and, without uttering the name
                                      ,    ,                          

“Shakespeare,” passionately addresses the monument thus:
“           ,”                                         :




“False marble! Where lies the great Shakespeare? Nothing but sordid
“            !                                 ?                   

dust lies here.”
              .”




Having heard the speech, we come to prepare it for the printed page.
                       ,                                           .

How shall we punctuate the part of it now under consideration so as to
                                                                      

convey the meaning expressed by the speaker in the break made after
                                                                   

the word “great”? Mr. De Vinne’s mode (No. 28-2) of printing the
         “     ”?   .         ’       (  .   - )                

language fails to show the grammatical end of the first group of words
                                                                      

(the inscription); and, in the absence of such knowledge, the reader
(               );    ,                                 ,           

will not readily catch the relation of “great” to “false marble.” Mr.
                                       “     ”    “            .”   .

Wilson (No. 28) shows the change in two ways: by a change in the style
       (  .   )                             :                         

of letters in the first word after the dash, and by beginning this
                                           ,                      

word with a capital letter. The sense of the language clearly shows
                          .                                        

that the first group of words would have ended, in the absence of the
                                              ,                      

dash, where the dash ends. The change from the style of letters (small
    ,                    .                                      (     

capitals) also shows this. As the practice of using no period after a
        )                .                                           

dash in sentences like No. 28 is thoroughly established, the reader
                         .                             ,           

learns from the first letter of the next word whether such word begins
                                                                      

a new sentence. As printed in Mr. De Vinne’s work, “false,” beginning
              .                 .         ’      , “     ,”          

with a small letter, appears to be a part of what precedes, giving the
                   ,                                      ,           

meaning of “the great, false marble.” As printed in Mr. Wilson’s work,
           “         ,             .”                 .       ’      ,

“False” begins a new sentence, and should have the usual space before
“     ”                      ,                                       

it; but is it correct?
  ;                  ?




Mr. Bigelow, apparently seeing the difficulty we are discussing, puts
  .        ,                                                   ,     

a space after the dash, thus ending the sentence with the dash. This
                      ,                                       .     

of course requires that “false” begin with a capital letter, the word
                        “     ”                            ,         

being the first word in a new sentence.
                                      .




We believe that if “false” is written with a capital letter, thus
                   “     ”                                 ,     

making a new sentence, the dash should be followed by the space that is
                     ,                                                 

used to separate sentences.
                          .




Our conclusions would require that the sentence be written in the
                                                                 

following way:

  28-3. “Here lies the great”— False marble! where?
    - . “                   ”—             !      ?




Let it be remembered that we are attempting in the above sentence to
                                                                    

reproduce on the printed page _what_ a speaker said and _how_ he said

If the first four words are a part of the inscription, the fact must be

shown; and it is shown in No. 28-3 by the quotation-marks. The use of
     ;                      .   -                  -     .           

small capitals in No. 28 is much more suggestive of an inscription than
                    .

In our next illustrative sentence, the grammatical connection within

the sentence is perfect, but the sense changes. Here the dash is used
                       ,                      .                      

to suspend the thought in preparation for the surprise to come. It is a
                                                              .        

rhetorical mark, for it indicates how the words would be spoken:
               ,                                               :




  29. He never lacked a good word—from those who spoke his praise.
    .                            —                               .




A speaker or a writer often wishes to repeat a part of or all that he
                                                                     

has said, and then continue with his line of thought, using different
        ,                                           ,                

words for emphasis, for exactness, or for other reasons. Or he may
                  ,              ,                     .          

wish in this way to summarize what he has already said, completing the
                                                      ,               

sentence with the summarizing word as the subject. There seems to be no
                                                 .                     

grammatical relation between the summarizing group of words and what
                                                                    

precedes them. The dash serves to show the break in the sentence, and
             .                                                  ,    

is thus merely a rhetorical mark:
                                :




  30. He has been unkindly—he has been shamefully treated.
    .                     —                              .




  31. Persecution, injustice, ruined fortune—all seemed insignificant.
    .            ,          ,               —                        .




The office of the dash in each of the above sentences might be
                                                              

performed by a blank space of equal length; but such space might not
                                          ;                         

always be easily distinguished from the usual spaces between words.
                                                                  .




Some English writers use dots or two or more periods where we use
                                                                 

dashes in sentences like the above.
                                  .







Our next illustrative sentence, with its modifications, shows a very
                              ,                       ,             

useful and quite indispensable office of the dash. The sentence
                                                 .             

exemplifies one of the commonest errors made by good writers.
                                                            .




  32. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted to school officers,

  trustees, inspectors, and commissioners.
          ,           ,                  .




  32-1. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted to school
    - .

          :         ,           ,                  .




  32-2. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted to school
    - .                                                        

  officers (trustees, inspectors, and commissioners).
           (        ,           ,                  ).




  32-3. The expenditure of this vast sum is entrusted to school
    - .                                                        

  officers,—trustees, inspectors, and commissioners.
          ,—        ,           ,                  .




The punctuation of No. 32 is erroneous, for it does not show the
                     .                ,                         

relation between “school officers” and what follows.
                 “               ”                 .




That of No. 32-1 is not bad; but the words following “school officers”
          .   -            ;                         “               ”

are not formally introduced, and therefore do not require a colon.
                           ,                                     .




That of No. 32-2 is not wholly bad; but the words introduced are not a
          .   -                   ;                                   

pure parenthesis, and to use the marks of parenthesis in this way would
                ,                                                      

unduly extend their office.
                          .




That of No. 32-3 is the best, because the true relation (apposition)
          .   -             ,                           (          )

of the words is maintained, and is shown by a mark (the comma) already
                          ,                        (         )        

seen to be the proper mark for this relation. The failure of the
                                            .                   

comma to show the relation of apposition in No. 32 is due to the fact
                                              .                      

that the words following “officers” form an _apparent_ series with
                         “        ”                               

“officers.” The comma here needs re-enforcing by a special grouping
“        .”                        -                               

mark, which office the dash performs. The comma shows the relation; the
    ,                               .                             ;    

dash does the grouping.
                      .




We spoke above of extending the office and limiting the value of a
                                                                  

mark. We mean by this that the more uses and, in consequence, the
    .                                       ,               ,    

more meanings a mark has, the more difficult it is for the reader to
                        ,                                           

interpret it when he meets it. For this reason the comma and dash seem
                             .                                        

to be the best mode of punctuating sentences like the above.
                                                           .




As we saw in Sentence 6, the colon is used to mark the largest
                       ,                                      

divisions of a sentence; and it is used, as in Sentence 25, for the
                       ;               ,                  ,        

formal introduction of particulars. The former use is determined by the
                                  .                                    

colon’s rank, which is above the semicolon and below the period; the
     ’      ,                                                  ;    

latter use is conventional, and is without reference to its rank.
                          ,                                     .




If two colons appear in a sentence, one because of its rank and one in
                                  ,                                   

the enumeration of particulars, there may be a seeming inconsistency in
                              ,                                        

grouping. The same is true when a colon is used within a group made by
        .                                                             

a semicolon. For instance, in No. 25-3 we used a colon in each of two
           .             ,      .   -                                

groups, the groups themselves being separated by a semicolon. We think
      ,                                                     .         

it much better to use within each group the comma and dash than to use
                                                                      

the colon, thus emphasizing the grouping done by the semicolon, instead
         ,                                                    ,        

of apparently subordinating the colon in each group to the semicolon
                                                                    

making the two groups. This would give the following punctuation for
                     .                                              

No. 25-3:
  .   - :




  33. In a bill of exchange there are three original parties,—drawer,
    .                                                       ,—      ,

  drawee, and payee; in a promissory note, only two,—maker and payee.
        ,          ;                     ,         ,—               .




We have thus used a comma and a dash to set off particulars formally
                                                                    

introduced, making the punctuation of No. 33 inconsistent with that of
          ,                             .                             

No. 25, and apparently inconsistent with No. 32-2. If this resulted in
  .   ,                                    .   - .                    

misleading a reader, objection might be raised; but, we feel confident,
                   ,                          ;    ,                  ,

this exceptional mode of punctuation is justified.
                                                 .







In our next illustrative sentence we get away from details either
                                                                 

formally or almost formally introduced; yet the relation to be shown by
                                      ;                                

the punctuation is just the same and quite as evident:
                                                     :




  34. She had a face altogether of the sunny south,—a pure skin, black
    .                                             ,—           ,      

  hair, and blue eyes.
      ,              .




Professor Wendell uses this punctuation a great deal and, we think,
                                                        ,         ,

very effectively. Other good writers do not use it at all; but they
                .                                        ;         

seem to have no satisfactory substitute for it. Professor Wendell
                                              .                  

frequently uses it twice in one sentence, as it is used in No. 33. The

              ,—                                       ,            

  and music; but oftener and more freely they are phrased in the terms
           ;

                                    ,—                     .




We may perhaps turn aside from our discussion of the dash to consider a
                                                                       

point in the above sentence which illustrates our general principle of
                                                                      

grouping, especially as exhibited in Sentences 10 to 10-3.
        ,                                              - .




Many punctuators would set off by commas the group “oftener and
                                                   “           

more freely” in No. 35 on the ground that it is “an intermediate
           ”      .                             “               

parenthetical group.” This would be thoughtless punctuation based upon
                   .”                                                 

a rule of questionable meaning. The _but_ relation in this sentence is
                              .                                       

between two groups of words restricted, respectively, in meaning by
                                      ,             ,              

“often” and “oftener”; and commas should not be permitted to destroy
“     ”     “       ”;                                              

a grouping that shows the contrast. Somewhat shortened, the sentence
                                  .                   ,             

would read thus, readily exhibiting the point under consideration:
               ,                                                 :




  35-1. These records are _often_ set forth in terms of architecture;
    - .                                                             ;

  but _oftener_ they are phrased in terms of language.
                                                     .




The italicized words here emphasize the restriction of the thoughts
                                                                   

that are in the _but_ relation in this sentence. In No. 10-2 commas
                                               .      .   -        

perform this office by holding the proper words in the _but_ relation.
                                                                     .

We may not assert that commas in the second clause of No. 35 would
                                                        .         

change the meaning to the extent that it is changed by the absence of
                                                                     

commas in No. 10-1; but the point of emphasis would be somewhat changed
            .   - ;                                                    

by their use in No. 35.
                  .   .







The combination of a comma and a dash to express apposition is most
                                                                   

useful when the thing to be explained by the appositive words is
                                                                

suggested, as in No. 34, and not indicated, as in No. 33. We find a
         ,         .   ,                  ,         .   .          

good illustration of this point in Gray’s Elegy as punctuated by the
                                       ’                            

author; and we also find in this illustration what, we believe, is
      ;                                           ,           ,   

a late development of the dash. The poet Gray was one of the most
                              .                                  

painstaking writers known in literature. There was a comma in the first
                                       .                               

line of the manuscript of his Elegy in a Country Churchyard when sent
                                                                     

to the printer:
              :




  35A. The curfew tolls, the knell of parting day.
     .                 ,                         .




The comma here means just what the comma in No. 34 means. What follows
                                              .         .             

“tolls” is in apposition with the thing which “the curfew tolls”
“     ”                                       “                ”

suggests, as what follows the comma and dash in No. 34 is in apposition
        ,                                         .                    

with a picture suggested by what precedes. The suggestion in No. 35A is
                                         .                     .       

less apparent and more subtle than in No. 34.
                                        .   .




The printer who received the manuscript of the Elegy did not see the
                                                                    

picture, and so left out the comma, thus making the intransitive verb
       ,                          ,                                  

“tolls” a transitive verb. The poet’s musical ear felt the improvement
“     ”                  .         ’                                  

made thus unconsciously by the printer; and the change was accepted.
                                      ;                            .




In order more clearly to show the meaning of the manuscript line, we
                                                                ,   

should punctuate it with the comma and dash:
                                           :




  35A-1. The curfew tolls,—the knell of parting day.
     - .                 ,—                        .




Thus the dash is an aid to the comma in grouping the appositive words,
                                                                     ,

especially when following a thought only implied.
                                                .




There is a very common use of the dash that is commended by all writers
                                                                       

on punctuation; but not one of these writers has formulated a rule that
              ;                                                        

differentiates the dash so used from marks of parenthesis.
                                                         .




A writer frequently uses a group of words that are _purely_
                                                           

parenthetical in nature; and yet he desires to give them grammatical
                       ;                                            

connection with the sentence. Such connection clearly takes them out
                            .                                       

of the class of groups of words requiring marks of parenthesis; but,
                                                              ;    ,

because of their purely parenthetical nature, it does not put them into
                                            ,                          

the class requiring commas or semicolons alone. As the group retains a
                                              .                       

twofold nature, such nature may well be shown by two marks. If it be
              ,                                           .         

said this is not good reasoning, we may well resort to a rule which,
                               ,                                   ,

with the explanation of the conditions above given, together with a
                                                  ,                

very general practice, will quite distinctly differentiate the class of
                     ,                                                 

sentences to be thus punctuated. Such a rule will have, at least, the
                               .                      ,         ,    

merit of producing a certain degree of uniformity in punctuation. The
                                                                .    

rule may be about as follows:
                            :




  RULE.—Matter that is purely parenthetical in nature, and
      .—                                             ,    

  yet is given grammatical connection, slight or otherwise, with what
                                     ,                    ,          

  precedes it, may be set off by a dash or dashes together with the
             ,                                                     

  mark that would be required by the language with the parenthetical
                                                                    

  matter omitted.
                .




One or two sentences will illustrate the points under discussion:
                                                                :




  36. He cannot understand—nor can any of his leisurely countrymen—why
    .                     —                                       —   

  tomorrow will not answer as well as today.
                                           .




The matter here set off by dashes is a side-remark, purely
                                           -      ,       

parenthetical in nature, but given grammatical connection by the use of
                       ,                                               

the conjunction “nor.” If the matter were not purely parenthetical, it
                “   .”                                            ,   

would, of course, not take the dashes. A sentence similar in form will
     ,          ,                    .                                

illustrate this point:
                     :




  36-1. He cannot understand, nor does he want to understand, why
    - .                     ,                               ,    

  tomorrow will not answer as well as today.
                                           .




In the next sentence the grammatical relation is in the nature
                                                              

of apposition; and yet what follows “heroines” is not purely an
             ;                      “        ”                 

appositive, for all “female characters” are not “heroines.” The added
          ,         “                 ”         “        .”          

thought goes beyond the office of parenthetical matter, and becomes an
                                                      ,               

integral part of the sentence, which cannot be omitted without changing
                             ,                                         

the sense:
         :




  37. George Eliot’s heroines—her female characters, from first to
    .             ’          —                     ,              

  last—are drawn with the serene firmness of omniscience.
      —                                                 .




The group of words here set off by dashes expresses too much to be
                                                                  

either an appositive of “heroines” or a parenthesis explaining the
                        “        ”                                

meaning of “heroines”; in short, it is neither wholly one nor the
           “        ”;         ,                                 

other, and cannot be properly punctuated as belonging to one or the
     ,                                                             

other class of words.
                    .




It may be well to note here the difference between Sentences 36 and
                                                                   

37 and Sentence 32-3, the latter being a type of sentences often
                  - ,                                           

improperly punctuated when the sentence is continued beyond the
                                                               

appositive group of words. We have just read such a sentence in the
                         .                                         

morning newspaper:
                 :




  38. There is literature in our newspapers—a lively, colloquial, vivid
    .                                      —        ,           ,      

  literature, reflective of the life we lead—and we are grateful for
            ,                               —                       

  his [Augustine Birrell’s] admonition that in the making of it we have
      [                 ’ ]                                            

  regard first for truth and afterward for beauty, if we find it.
                                                 ,              .




The error in the punctuation of the above sentence was probably due
                                                                   

to the lack of a clear definition, in the mind of the writer, of the
                                 ,                          ,       

meanings of the dash. The relation of the matter between the dashes
                    .                                              

to what precedes is clearly that of apposition; and the dash alone is
                                              ;                      

quite generally used to express it. We prefer, however, the comma and
                                  .          ,        ,              

dash, as was shown in our discussion of No. 32.
    ,                                     .   .




This relation makes the appositive group of words a part of what

               ,                                                 

appositive group of words. This puts the _and_ relation between the two
                         .                                             

_larger_ groups of the sentence, thus making the use of the second dash
                               ,                                       

erroneous, and requiring a new grouping. A semicolon will best perform
         ,                             .

Punctuated in accordance with the above reasoning, and with some commas
                                                 ,                     

added, the sentence will read as follows:

  it.

THE DASH AS A PARAGRAPH-MARK
                       -    




In order to save space, the dash is used, purely conventionally,
                      ,                 ,                      ,

between paragraphs not put in paragraph form,—that is, between
                                            ,—       ,        

paragraphs run together, as are sentences. Such usage may be seen
                       ,                 .

                                  ,

  Without knowing the meaning of the three technical terms in the above
                                                                       

  sentence, the reader is informed by the comma and dash that “the

      ;                                            .




  In this sentence “child’s play” is not sufficiently specific to
                   “     ’      ”                                

  define “economies”; and therefore the characteristics of “child’s

beautiful and successful life.

  In this example the comma is required because it would be required

  were omitted. The dashes set off the group, and thus connect what
              .                             ,

CHAPTER VI
          




PUNCTUATION BY REASON AND CONVENTION
                                    







We shall discuss in this chapter some uses of marks determined partly
                                                                     

by reason and partly by convention. In a subsequent chapter we shall
                                  .                                 

take up the purely conventional uses of marks.
                                             .




Among the commonest uses of marks is that of a comma before the
                                                               

conjunction _that_ introducing a group of words. Our next two examples

illustrate two classes of sentences in which “that” connects the
                                             “    ”             

parts of each sentence somewhat differently, permitting a difference

in punctuation. As such modes of punctuation are not well settled by
              .

No comma is required after “holds” in No. 39 because there is no

noun, noun to verb, verb to object, etc.

In Sentence 40 “that” does not grow out of or coalesce with “is” as
               “    ”                                       “  ”   

“that” grows out of and coalesces with “holds” in No. 39. The reader
“    ”                                 “     ”      .   .           

almost invariably pauses after “is” in such relations, as if to group
                               “  ”                  ,

  generative force.
                  .




Let us note that the relation here marked by a comma is quite
                                                             

suggestive of two similar relations which we indicated, respectively,
                                                      ,             ,

by a colon (Sentence 26-3) and by a comma and dash (Sentence 34). It is
           (           - )                         (           ).      

plain that the relation in each of the three sentences (Nos. 26-3, 34,
                                                       (   .   - ,   ,

  )                      ;                                      ,    

so we punctuate the three sentences differently, each sentence falling
                                               ,                      

into a different class.
                      .




While the above sentences present no difficulty in their punctuation,
                                                                    ,

the punctuation of other sentences quite like them seems to be somewhat
                                                                       

puzzling, yet it is based upon reason.

In court decisions the finding or findings generally appear in a
                                                                

separate paragraph or paragraphs, following a review of the case.
                                ,                               .

The punctuation here is not entirely uniform; but, although it seems
                                            ;    ,                  

inconsistent with that of No. 39, it is easily explained:
                            .   ,                       :




  42. Held, that the evidence is material.
    .     ,                              .




If the decision covers two or more points, it may take this form:
                                         ,                      :




  42-1. Held—
    - .     —




  1. That the evidence is material.
   .                              .




  2. That the lower court did not err in its instructions to the jury.
   .                                                                 .




If there is a reason for the use of a comma after “held” in No. 42, the
                                                  “    ”      .   ,    

same reason seems to require a comma after “held” in No. 42-1, the dash
                                           “    ”      .   - ,         

being used for another purpose, to be considered later. A comma is not
                              ,                       .               

used in No. 42-1, because its omission is the _conventional_ usage.
          .   - ,                                                 .




The punctuation of No. 42 probably follows the mode of reading the
                     .                                            

sentence, a decided pause being made after “held,” which would not be
        ,                                  “    ,”                   

the case in reading No. 39.
                      .   .




It could not be said that a colon after “this” in No. 41 would not be
                                        “    ”      .                

good punctuation.
                .




As we have said elsewhere, Mr. Wilson’s work is very masterful and
                         ,   .       ’

          ,                                 ;                      

justified in drawing frequent lessons from it. We take from it our
                                             .

                               ,                                

wonder how there can be a difference in their punctuation after the
                                                                   

verb followed by “that”:
                 “    ”:

    .                            ,      “                      ,      

  are addressed to the eye of the reader, are insufficient for the

  porches of the ear.’”
                    .’”




  44. Mr. Maglathlin says that “the comma occurs sometimes where there
    .   .                      “                                      

  should be no pause in reading or speaking; nor can the length of
                                           ;                      

  any required stop be inferred with much certainty from the common
                                                                   

  stop-mark used.”
      -         .”




We fail to find a rule in Mr. Wilson’s work explaining the use of the
                            .       ’                                

comma before “that” in No. 43. The sentences, however, are taken, not
             “    ”      .   .              ,        ,          ,    

from Mr. Wilson’s illustrative examples, but from the text of his work;
       .       ’                       ,                              ;

and therefore the punctuation is more likely a typographical error.
                                                                  .







FIRST, SECOND, WHEN, NOW, BECAUSE, ETC.
     ,       ,     ,    ,        ,    .




Writers on punctuation seem to find the use of marks required by such

        ;                                                             

puzzling to the reader.

This punctuation falls quite readily under the principles of grouping

In No. 45 the speaker makes in the first three words a statement
     .                                                          

which may be merely an assumption; and, perceiving this fact as the
                                 ;    ,

language. This he does by the insertion of a _slightly_ parenthetical
        .                                                            

word (perhaps). Besides having this parenthetical character, “perhaps”
     (       ).                                            , “       ”

has here also a squinting character (looking both ways),—that is, it
                                    (                 ),—       ,   

may be intended to qualify what precedes it or what follows it. As it

                                                   ,                

determine what it does qualify; and this he readily determines from

his knowledge of language. Of course, it here qualifies the statement

In No. 46 “perhaps” stands in the regular position of a word that
     .    “       ”                                              

qualifies what immediately follows it, and therefore needs no mark.

The commas in this sentence are used to _suspend_ a group of words,

even here it would require the commas, because it is an appositive.

  least after it; it likewise stands, as a conjunction, in the natural
                ;                   ,                 ,               

  position of a conjunction, and therefore no mark is required after
                           ,                                        

  it; it also sometimes stands, as either part of speech, out of the
    ;                         ,                         ,           

  regular order of such part of speech, breaking the continuous flow
                                      ,                             

  of the thought, and thus becoming _slightly_ parenthetical and
                ,                                               

  requiring the marks (commas) used to show this office of the word.
                      (      )                                     .

  If, therefore, this distinction between the word’s uses be carefully
    ,          ,                                  ’                   

  noted, the punctuation required will not be difficult to learn.
       ,                                                        .




The above sentence will serve to illustrate the punctuation required
                                                                    

by “therefore” and also by its synonyms, which are _accordingly_,
   “         ”                         ,                        ,

_because_, _hence_, _since_, _thence_, _wherefore_, etc. These
         ,        ,        ,         ,            ,    .      

words belong to a large group of words whose punctuation is readily
                                                                   

determined by the sense relations. The word _however_, in its relation
                                 .                   ,                

to other parts of the sentence, will serve to emphasize the distinction
                              ,                                        

between the two uses of many of these words:
                                           :




  48. He was reluctant to discuss the subject. He replied, however, to
    .                                        .           ,        ,   

  all questions put to him, however pointed such questions were.
                          ,                                    .




This sentence may be so formed as to bring the first “however” into the
                                                     “       ”         

usual position of the conjunction:
                                 :




  48-1. He was reluctant to discuss the subject; however, he replied to
    - .                                        ;        ,              

  all questions put to him, however pointed such questions were.
                          ,                                    .




In this form, another word, _but_, _yet_, _although_, or the like,
            ,             ,      ,      ,           ,            ,

would be preferred to the first “however.”
                                “       .”




The relation indicated by the word _because_ is easily misunderstood,
                                                                    ,

and therefore often wrongly indicated in the punctuation by the
                                                               

presence or absence of a mark. The meaning of a sentence may thus be
                             .                                      

entirely changed by the punctuation:
                                   :




  49. John did not go to town because his father was absent.
    .                                                      .




  49-1. John did not go to town, because his father was absent.
    - .                        ,                              .




No. 49 asserts that John went to town, and states that his reason for
  .                                  ,                               

going was not his father’s absence. No. 49-1 asserts that John did
                        ’         .   .   -                       

_not_ go to town, and that the reason for not going was his father’s
                ,                                                 ’ 

absence. In No. 49 the language is used in its natural order and
       .      .                                                 

without any turn in the thought, which is not complete until the end
                               ,                                    

of the sentence is reached. In No. 49-1 the same language is made to
                          .      .   -                              

give an entirely different meaning by changing the relation between the
                                                                       

two groups of words constituting the sentence. A like change of real
                                             .                      

meaning is seen in Sentences 13 and 13-1; and a like change of apparent
                                      - ;                              

meaning is seen in Sentences 1 and 1-1. This principle is clearly
                                    - .                          

exemplified in Sentences 11-1 and 11-2.
                           -        - .




A very important principle of language is involved in this punctuation;
                                                                      ;

and we should thoroughly comprehend it. In No. 49 the relation
                                      .      .                

expressed by “not” goes on to the group of words beginning with
             “   ”                                             

“because,” although apparently confined to “go.” In No. 49-1 the
“       ,”                                 “  .”      .   -     

relation is confined entirely to “go.” We find a counterpart of this
                                 “  .”                              

form of expression in the use of “only” and similar modifiers. “Only”
                                 “    ”                      . “    ”

is used out of place so generally, often by excellent writers, that we
                                 ,                           ,        

hesitate to criticize such usage. In the expression, _I only assisted
                                .                  ,                 

the boys to work the example_, we are not sure whether the writer means
                             ,                                         

to say that he _only_ assisted,—that is, did not do all the work; or
                              ,—       ,                        ;   

that he assisted _only_ the boys,—that is, not the girls; or that he
                                ,—       ,              ;           

assisted them _only_ to work the example, and not to explain it.
                                        ,                      .




A careful writer will always avoid such ambiguous expressions, for
                                                             ,    

it is not easy for the reader to differentiate the meanings in such
                                                                   

sentences as Nos. 49 and 49-1.
                .          - .







Our next two sentences (Nos. 50 and 51) are especially interesting
                       (   .          )                           

because of their sources. No. 50 is a part of Mr. Teall’s general
                        .   .                   .      ’         

rule (page 1) for the use of the comma; and No. 51 is a sentence from
     (      )                         ;       .                      

the text of Mr. Wilson’s work (page 3), quoted by Mr. Teall in the
              .       ’       (      ),             .             

discussion of his own rule.
                          .




We quote No. 50, not to consider it as a rule, but to consider the use
           .   ,                             ,                        

of the comma in its language. No. 51, as it appears in Mr. Wilson’s
                            .   .   ,                    .       ’ 

work, has a comma before “unless”; and Mr. Teall quotes the sentence to
    ,                    “      ”;       .                             

illustrate an erroneous use of the comma:
                                        :




  50. When there is no break in sense no comma should be used, unless
    .                                                        ,       

  necessary for clearness of expression.
                                       .




  51. Scarcely can a sentence be perused with satisfaction or interest,
    .                                                                 ,

  unless pointed with some degree of accuracy.
                                             .




No. 50, like No. 49-1, is practically completed at the comma, what
  .   ,        .   - ,                                      ,     

follows in each being added as an additional thought. In No. 51 the
                                                    .      .       

language up to the comma is almost meaningless, or, at least, makes an
                                              ,   ,         ,         

untrue statement. What follows the comma _restricts_ the assertion to a
                .                                                      

definite and true statement, just as what follows the comma in No. 49
                           ,                                     .   

_restricts_ the meaning of the assertion made in the language preceding
                                                                       

it. Because of this relation between the parts no comma is used, and
  .                                                            ,    

for the reasons already discussed.
                                 .




Sentences 50 and 51 are not unlike Sentences 13 and 13-1; and therefore
                                                      - ;              

the same reasoning determines their punctuation.
                                               .




Mr. Wilson’s use of a comma before “unless” in No. 51 is wrong, and is
  .       ’                        “      ”      .            ,       

contrary to one of his own rules.
                                .




Such mistakes can be found, probably, in the text-book of every writer
                          ,         ,            -                    

on punctuation. They are generally mere oversights, and should not be
              .                                   ,                  

construed as evidence of the writer’s lack of knowledge. It is the
                                   ’                   .          

system of a writer which determines the value or lack of value of his
                                                                     

work.
    .







The punctuation between clauses connected by _when_, _where_, and like
                                                   ,        ,         

connectives, presents difficulties only when an attempt is made to rob
           ,                                                          

such connectives of their apparent meanings, respectively, of time and
                                           ,             ,            

place, as is done by some writers, and perhaps correctly in rare cases.
     ,                           ,                                    .







In each of our next three illustrative sentences the thought of time is
                                                                       

equally manifest; and therefore there is no more need of a comma in one
                ;                                                      

than in the other:
                 :




  52. You may fire _when_ you are ready, Gridley.
    .                                  ,        .




  52-1. You may fire _now_, Gridley.
    - .                   ,        .




  52-2. You may go _tomorrow_, Gridley.
    - .                      ,        .




It is true that “when” may lose, at least in a measure, its sense
                “    ”         ,                      ,          

of time, and then indicate a somewhat different relation between
       ,                                                        

the clauses it connects. Mr. Wilson gives the following sentence to
                       .   .                                       

illustrate this point:
                     :




  53. Refrain not to speak, when by speaking you may be useful to
    .                     ,                                      

  others.
        .




Here “when” may not refer to time, but may be equivalent to _if_, thus
     “    ”                      ,                              ,     

introducing a condition under which to speak; or it may be equivalent
                                            ;                        

to _because_, thus giving a reason. Such meaning would make a sentence
            ,                     .                                   

very much like No. 49-1.
                 .   - .




We find an exact counterpart of No. 53, with similar punctuation, in
                                  .   ,                         ,   

the following sentence from the New Testament, Common Version:
                                             ,               :




  53-1. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you.
    - .               ,                          .




The same sentence in the Revised Version appears without the comma,
                                                                  ,

thus giving “when” its full sense of time:
            “    ”                       :




  53-2. Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you.
    - .                                           .




In Sentence 47 we saw the various uses of the word “therefore”; and in
                                                   “         ”;       

Sentences 48 and 48-1 we saw the different meanings of “however” with
                   -                                   “       ”     

a change of position. In our next five or six sentences, we shall see
                    .                                  ,             

that the meaning to be conveyed determines the relation, this relation
                                                       ,              

being indicated by the mark of punctuation:
                                          :




  54. Fortunately for me, the work was easy.
    .                   ,                  .




  54-1. Fortunately, for me the work was easy.
    - .            ,                         .




In No. 54 the good fortune (fortunately) is for me, as if the language
     .                     (           )          ,                   

read, “It was fortunate for me.” In 54-1 the comma cuts “fortunately”
    , “                       .”      -                 “           ”

off from “for me”; and the meaning is thus changed.
         “      ”;                                .




If the meaning of No. 54-1 is not perfectly clear to the reader, it may
                    .   -                                      ,       

be made so by a change in the form of the sentence:
                                                  :




  54-2. Fortunately, the work was easy for me.
    - .            ,                         .




Sentence 54 is not capable of such transposition; and this shows that
                                                ;                    

the sentences are different in meaning.
                                      .




Words and groups of words like this and in like use are very numerous;
                                                                     ;

yet practically all of them readily fall into their respective classes,
                                                                      ,

and are easily punctuated. A change in meaning, however, even without a
                         .                    ,        ,               

change in form, will require different punctuation, although the proper
              ,                                   ,                    

punctuation is rarely seen. That it is so seems strange in view of the
                          .                                           

fact that the meaning logically permits of no other than the obviously
                                                                      

correct punctuation:
                   :




  55. In conclusion, I wish to say that the evidence does not justify
    .              ,                                                 

  the verdict.
             .




The relation of “in conclusion” will be clearly seen if we transfer the
                “             ”                                        

term:
    :




  55-1. I wish to say, in conclusion, that the evidence does not
    - .              ,              ,                           

  justify the verdict.
                     .




In each of these sentences “in conclusion” is merely an adverb
                           “             ”                    

equivalent to _finally_. If we make it equivalent to a clause, and
                       .                                     ,    

thus prevent its performing the office of an adverb, its relation is
                                                   ,                

changed, and its new relation will determine the punctuation. Such a
       ,                                                    .       

change and such new relation are seen in the next sentence:
                                                          :




  55-2. In conclusion: the jury seemed unable to comprehend either
    - .              :                                            

  the evidence or the charge of the judge; the judge was not entirely
                                         ;                           

  free from prejudice; and the prisoner was unable to obtain important
                     ;                                                

  evidence.
          .




Here “in conclusion” seems to bear no grammatical relation to what
     “             ”                                              

follows. It is, however, the remnant of a clause which bears the
       .      ,        ,                                        

_colon_ relation to what follows; and therefore the colon is used after
                                ;                                      

it. Such a clause might read thus, “I will state, in conclusion, the
  .                              , “            ,              ,    

facts in the case.”
                 .”







YES, NO, AGAIN, ETC.
   ,   ,      ,    .




The words _yes_, _no_, _again_, _to sum up_, _to proceed_, etc., are
               ,     ,        ,            ,             ,    .,    

often used in this way, and so require the colon:
                      ,                         :




  56. Do you think he will meet the expectations of his friends? Yes:
    .                                                          ?    :

  he has never failed to meet reasonable expectations.
                                                     .




Apparently in the absence of a comprehension of the _colon_ relation
                                                                    

between “yes” or “no” and what follows, even careful punctuators
        “   ”    “  ”                 ,                         

seem to prefer the semicolon after these words; and, it may be said,
                                              ;    ,               ,

convention thus overrides reason, making the semicolon far more common
                                ,                                     

than the colon for this punctuation.
                                   .




The conventional punctuation of the sentence is as follows:
                                                          :




  56-1. Do you think he will meet the expectations of his friends? Yes;
    - .                                                          ?    ;

  he has never failed to meet reasonable expectations.
                                                     .




As marks are used mainly to assist the reader in so grouping words
                                                                  

that their relations may be readily seen, it is apparent that a mark
                                        ,                           

is not needed when the grouping is unmistakable in its absence. There
                                                              .      

is a large class of groups so formed and so connected that a mark
                                                                 

of punctuation between them is superfluous, although used quite in
                                          ,                       

accordance with our general principle, as exemplified in Sentences 1
                                     ,                              

and 1-1. The following sentence exhibits such grouping:
     - .                                              :




  57. The author was identified with Maine in blood and spirit and in
    .                                                                

  the ideals of life.
                    .




In this sentence the first “and” clearly connects “blood” and “spirit,”
                           “   ”                  “     ”     “      ,”

forming a group governed by the preposition “in.” Because of the
                                            “  .”               

absence of a mark before the second “and,” the reader, in view of what
                                    “   ,”           ,                

has been said in our discussion, might expect the word following the
                               ,                                    

second “and” to have the same sense relation to “spirit” that “spirit”
       “   ”                                    “      ”      “      ”

bears to “blood.” If such relation does not exist, then why should
         “     .”                                ,                

not a comma be used to notify the reader of the fact, as one was
                                                    ,           

used in Sentence 1-1? The reason is, that marks are used to prevent
                  - ?              ,                               

wrong groupings which are easily made because of apparent, but wrong,
                                                         ,          ,

relations. When the eye does not need a mark, the mark should be
         .                                  ,                   

omitted, even though consistency in punctuation seems to call for it.
       ,                                                            .




It is to be noted that “in blood and spirit” makes in itself a complete
                       “                   ”                           

group and a complete picture (the material and the immaterial), thus
                             (                               ),     

practically inhibiting the use of a third coördinate word connected
                                                                   

by “and”; moreover, the word “in” following the second “and” at
   “   ”;         ,          “  ”                      “   ”   

once notifies the reader that another _in_ group is to follow the
                                                                 

conjunction. For these reasons there is no liability even to momentary
           .                                                          

wrong grouping, and therefore no mark is needed before the second
              ,                                                  

“and.” This principle may be applied to somewhat long groups, if
“   .”                                                      ,   

similarly formed, even though the words beginning the groups are not
                ,                                                   

the same. This applies especially to groups formed by the correlative
        .                                                            

conjunctions, such as _either—or_, _neither—nor_, etc., the first
            ,                —   ,         —    ,    .,          

conjunction giving notice that its correlative is to introduce a group
                                                                      

bound to the preceding group by the expected complementary conjunction.
                                                                      .




If we closely followed the principle exemplified in Sentence 1-1, a
                                                              - ,  

comma would be required before the second “and” in No. 57. Such use
                                          “   ”      .   .         

of marks would be very “close” punctuation, which means subservience
                       “     ”            ,                         

to rules based upon an apparent principle. Close punctuation often
                                         .                        

becomes confusing by making so many groups of the words in a sentence

  therefore, as many good writers prefer this mode of punctuation, it

THEIR DIFFERENTIATION
                     







As has already been seen, we determine what mark of punctuation is
                        ,                                         

helpful at any point in written or printed language by the sense
                                                                

relation between two groups of words and by the degree of separation
                                                                    

between such groups. The degrees of separation cannot be so accurately
                   .                                                  

classified that there will not be much apparent and some real
                                                             

inconsistency in the punctuation of the most careful writer, and much
                                                           ,         

more in the uses of marks by different writers.
                                              .




We shall consider these points in this chapter, in order to show (1)
                                              ,                  ( )

the cause of this inconsistency; (2) how, in some measure, it may be
                               ; ( )    ,                ,          

avoided; and (3) that much of it is wholly immaterial, being not in the
       ;     ( )                                     ,                 

least misleading.
                .




A diagrammatic grouping indicated by the coordinate conjunction _and_,
                                                                     ,

with or without one of the four principal marks, may help to illustrate
                                               ,                       

the above points and to differentiate, to some extent, the uses of the

   .  ... ,     ...

   .  ... ;     ...

  4.  ... : and ...
   .  ... :     ...

  5.  ... . And ...

What does the absence of a mark before “and” in Diagram 1, and what
                                       “   ”             ,         

does each of the marks in the other diagrams, say to the reader, even
                                            ,                  ,     

before he has seen enough of what follows the conjunction to enable him
                                                                       

to apprehend the probable grouping?
                                  ?




We, of course, know that “and” connects words and groups of words which
  ,          ,           “   ”                                         

are coördinate in sense, and that such groups are often similar in
                       ,                                          

form. Similarity in form with similarity of relationship in groups of
    .                                                                

words makes reading easy; and much attention is given to it by good
                        ;                                          

writers.
       .




In Diagram 1 “and” stands between two words or groups of words whose
             “   ”                                                  

apparent relation is quite unmistakable for their real relation, which
                                                               ,      

was not the case in Sentence 1, which therefore required a mark of
                              ,                                   

punctuation. In other words, no mistake can be made, and therefore no
           .               ,                       ,                 

mark is needed. However this diagram may be filled out, “and” joins
              .                                       , “   ”      

words or groups of words into a single group, such new group being
                                            ,                     

related to some other word or group in the sentence.
                                                   .




Diagram 2 gives notice of a grouping different from that in Diagram 1;
                                                                     ;

and Diagrams 3, 4, and 5 exhibit still other groupings.
              ,  ,                                    .




We saw, particularly in Sentences 7, 7-1, and 7-2, a simple grouping
      ,                            ,  - ,      - ,                  

which plainly required another and a larger mark than the comma. We saw
                                                               .       

another kind of grouping in other sentences which also unmistakably
                                                                   

required a mark other than the semicolon.
                                        .




We now come to discuss the basis of differentiating our principal
                                                                 

marks, sometimes at points where the choice of a mark is not always
     ,                                                             

unmistakable. In some cases the choice is based upon well-defined sense
            .                                            -             

relations; in other cases it is based upon shades of meaning or upon
         ;                                                          

degrees of separation not sufficiently sharp to make the choice easy,
                                                                    ,

especially under _rules_ for punctuation.
                                        .




Sentence 1-1 is a good illustration of Diagram 2; and yet the apparent
          -                                     ;                     

relation between “children” and their “mothers” might so strongly
                 “        ”           “       ”                  

impress itself upon the mind of an inexperienced reader, especially
                                                       ,           

if reading the sentence at sight and aloud, that the comma would not
                                          ,                         

prevent a momentary wrong combination of these words. A semicolon
                                                    .            

before the conjunction would prevent the liability to such error, and
                                                                ,    

probably do so even with the most inexperienced reader. Thus we have
                                                      .             

a choice between the comma and the semicolon in Sentence 1; and this
                                                          ;         

choice rests upon the degree of liability to error, which cannot be
                                                  ,                

the same with different classes of readers. Liability to error in
                                          .                      

grouping is increased by a closeness of _apparent_ relations that
                                                                 

are _wrong_ relations, and also by a reader’s lack of expertness in
                     ,                     ’                       

grouping language at sight. In view of these facts, we think the use of
                          .                       ,                    

a semicolon in Sentence 1 better punctuation than the use of a comma;
                                                                    ;

but the use of the semicolon in this particular sentence should not be
                                                                      

made to justify a rule requiring a semicolon between every two clauses
                                                                      

connected by a conjunction, or between two clauses so connected, one of
                          ,                                    ,       

which contains one or more commas.
                                 .







Our next sentence is taken from an essay, in a high-class magazine, by
                                        ,          -              ,   

the professor of English in a leading eastern university; and this
                                                        ;         

essay has for its title “Writing English”:
                        “               ”:




  58. The boy must be able to say what he knows, or write what he
    .                                          ,                 

  knows, or he does not know it.
       ,                       .




As written and punctuated, this sentence contains three apparently
                         ,                                        

coördinate groups of words, the groups being connected by “or,” and the
                          ,                               “  ,”        

grouping indicated by commas. It is, however, composed of only two main
                            .      ,        ,                          

groups, the first of the two groups being regrouped into other groups.
      ,                                                              .

Such grouping should always be shown by the punctuation; for, when it
                                                       ;    ,        

is not so shown, the sentence cannot be read without some distractive
               ,                                                     

effect upon the reader and, if read aloud, also upon the hearer.
                          ,              ,                     .




The failure of this sentence to read smoothly, or without distractive
                                             ,                       

effect, arises from the usual cause: the form of the language leads
      ,                            :                               

the reader to look forward to a mode of development of the sentence
                                                                   

which does not follow,—that is, the _apparent_ mode of development, as
                     ,—       ,                                   ,   

exhibited in the grouping, is not the _real_ mode of development. As
                         ,                                      .   

each of the second and third groups is introduced by “or” and preceded
                                                     “  ”             

by a comma, the reader is led to look for the same relation between the
          ,                                                            

second and third groups that exists between the first and second. He is
                                                                .      

thus led to expect a group in a series, which does not follow.
                                      ,                      .




The distractive effect of the sentence can be removed in some degree
                                                                    

by writing it in the following form, the added “to” giving the second
                                   ,           “  ”                  

group a form similar to that of the first:
                                         :




  58-1. The boy must be able to say or _to_ write what he knows, or he
    - .                                                        ,      

  does not know it.
                  .




In this condensed form the sentence lacks, at the point of
                                         ,                

condensation, the emphasis of the original; and therefore the sentence
            ,                             ;                           

is not so effective in its statement of a truth. If, then, the original
                                               .   ,     ,             

form is preferred, its distractive effect can be removed by the use of
                 ,                                                    

punctuation that properly groups its parts:
                                          :




  58-2. The boy must be able to say what he knows, or write what he
    - .                                          ,                 

  knows; or he does not know it.
       ;                       .




The semicolon here _disconnects_ the second group from the third,
                                                                ,

giving the third group connection with a larger group, the first and
                                                     ,              

second combined.
               .




The need of the semicolon in No. 58-2 is not determined by the presence
                               .   -                                   

of the preceding comma, but mainly by the apparent relations of the
                      ,                                            

groups, such apparent relations being emphasized by the presence of the
      ,                                                                

second “or,” which makes the three groups appear to be in a series. If
       “  ,”                                                      .   

these groups were in a series, the second “or” would connect the second
                             ,            “  ”                         

and third groups. The semicolon at once throws the grouping into two
                .                                                   

parts, thus making the second “or” connect all that precedes with all
     ,                        “  ”                                   

that follows.
            .




Although the writer of Sentence 58 appears to have placed no value upon
                                                                       

the _like_ formation of the first two groups of this sentence, nor to
                                                             ,       

have recognized the differentiation of the comma from the semicolon, he
                                                                   ,   

uses both of these devices in a sentence, quite like the above, in the
                                        ,                     ,       

next paragraph of his essay. It is as follows:
                           .                 :




  59. It is here that composition is of service to the imagination,
    .                                                             ,

  and incidentally to culture; and I should speak more largely of this
                             ;                                        

  service if there were space in this essay to bring forward all the
                                                                    

  aspects of college composition.
                                .




The need of the semicolon in both Nos. 58 and 59 is, we think,
                                     .             ,         ,

unmistakable.
            .




The comma in No. 59 has no value for the reader. There is no _apparent_
               .                               .                       

and _wrong_ meaning here requiring this comma; and it is difficult to
                                             ;                       

see how any wrong grouping, in the absence of the comma, is likely to
                          ,                            ,             

be made by the reader. If this comma were challenged for its meaning we
                     .                                                 

do not know what answer it could give.
                                     .




The absence of a comma after “imagination” would give notice to the
                             “           ”                         

reader that what has been said about “imagination” is to be said about
                                     “           ”                    

something else in the _and_ relation to “imagination.” The writer,
                                        “           .”           ,

wishing to qualify the added statement, does so before the statement
                                      ,                             

is made, thus throwing matter (one word in this case) between what
       ,                      (                     )             

has preceded and what is to be grouped with “imagination,” as shown
                                            “           ,”         

by the absence of a mark before “and.” This makes the qualifying word
                                “   .”                               

a modified parenthesis. Such treatment of the word, indicated by
                      .                           ,             

marks, gives a shade of meaning difficult to express in language. The
     ,                                                          .    

difference is, perhaps, in the emphasis gained by the punctuation.
             ,        ,                                          .




We should write the sentence in the following way:
                                                 :




  59-1. It is here that composition is of service to the imagination
    - .                                                             

  and, incidentally, to culture; and I should speak more largely....
     ,             ,           ;                                ....




Our next sentence, which is taken from a well-known literary paper, is
                 ,                           -                    ,   

punctuated so badly that we wonder how it could pass an experienced
                                                                   

proof-reader:
     -      :




  60. Providence made him a waif on London streets and later, a waif on
    .                                                       ,          

  the ocean, she taught him the feeling of a rope’s end on a naked back.
           ,                                     ’                     .




When the reader reaches “and” in this sentence he needs to be informed
                        “   ”                                         

by a mark of punctuation that what immediately follows the conjunction
                                                                      

looks forward, not backward, for its connection. Such notice is always
             ,             ,                   .                      

imperative when the words immediately following the conjunction may
                                                                   

readily be attached by the reader to what precedes, but belong to what
                                                  ,                   

follows. In this sentence “a waif on the ocean” readily becomes the
       .                  “                   ”                    

object of “made”; and even a very careful reader might so connect it,
          “    ”;                                                   ,

not discovering his mistake until he reached “she taught him.” “Later”
                                             “              .” “     ”

apparently looks backward to “made”; but its connection is forward.
                             “    ”;                              .




Properly punctuated the sentence reads as follows:
                                                 :




  60-1. Providence made him a waif on London streets; and, later, a
    - .                                             ;    ,      ,  

  waif on the ocean, she taught him the feeling of a rope’s end on a
                   ,                                     ’          

  naked back.
            .




“Later” takes a comma before it because it is out of its natural order
“     ”                                                               

and also because it is placed in a position where it obstructs the
                                                                  

smoothness of the language. The position of both “later” and “a waif on

punctuation based upon the rank of the colon.

The use of the colon that is properly differentiated from the uses of
                                                                     

the semicolon and the period, respectively, is the use determined by

its rank. This particular use is exemplified in Sentences 6 and 6-2
        .                                                        -

latter use of the colon—and they are many in number—apparently ignore
                       —                           —                 

the real relations between the parts of a sentence or of a composition;
                                                                      ;

or, if they themselves see and appreciate such relations, they are
  ,                                                     ,         

willing to leave them obscurely expressed. It is quite probable that
                                         .                          

many writers do not know that marks of punctuation have inherent
                                                                

meanings which clearly express these relations. The lack of such

knowledge is explained by the almost total absence of any discussion of

Our statement that Sentences 26-3 and 27-1 illustrate only “to some

explanation. In Sentences 6 and 6-2 the colon is used because a mark
           .                     -

sentence, one part being subdivided by semicolons. This use is wholly
        ,                                        .                   

one of rank, and clearly differentiates the use of the mark. It is
           ,                                               .      

another sense relation of the parts of each of the other sentences
                                                                  

(Nos. 26-3 and 27-1) that requires the colon, and not the presence of a
(   .   -        - )                        ,                          

semicolon in one of the parts. The colon would still be the only mark
                             .                                       

with an inherent meaning expressive of the relation between the parts
                                                                     

even if there were no other mark in either sentence. The colon would
                                                   .                

still be the proper mark in No. 26-3 if it ended with “old,” and in No.
                              .   -                   “   ,”          .

following the colon in No. 26-3 is the _and_ relation, each group being
                         .   -                       ,                 

an expansion of a picture in the main group,—that is, the first group
                                           ,—       ,                

(it never grows old) explains “perpetual charm,” and the second group
(                  )          “               ,”

Our next sentence, which is from Balzac, will illustrate the points we
                 ,                     ,                              

are considering, and also show the difficulties the punctuator meets in
               ,                                                       

the punctuation of language which he may not change:
                                                   :




  61. He was all that a hero should be; he suffered long, and came into
    .                                 ;                 ,              

  his own, and he has been, in a measure, the world’s ideal of a heroic
         ,                ,             ,          ’                   

  man of arms.
             .




According to most rules of punctuation based upon grammatical
                                                             

relations, this punctuation is correct; according to the principles of
         ,                            ;                               

punctuation based upon sense relations, this punctuation is very bad.
                                      ,                             .

The obscurity in the meaning of the language cannot be wholly removed
                                                                     

by punctuation. Two simple statements are made in the sentence, and
              .                                               ,    

are coördinated by the second conjunction (and); but the language is
                                          (   );                    

so grouped by the punctuation as to conceal this fact. We can show the
                                                     .                

meaning by a different mode of punctuation, which, however, is not
                                          ,      ,        ,       

good punctuation. Such punctuation will show the relation because the
                .                                                    

meaning of the marks used is familiar to most readers:
                                                     :




  61-1. He was all that a hero should be (he suffered long, and came
    - .                                  (                ,         

  into his own); and he has been, in a measure, the world’s idea of a
              );                ,             ,          ’           

  heroic man of arms.
                    .




The parentheses show the relation of the matter so enclosed to what
                                                                   

has preceded; but the matter so set off is not a parenthesis, and
            ;                                               ,    

therefore the use of the marks of parenthesis is not good punctuation.
                                                                     .

It is true that the matter so set off is explanatory matter; but it is
                                                           ;          

an expansion of the idea preceding it, and therefore should be preceded
                                     ,                                 

by a colon.
          .




Having determined that a colon is the proper mark after this first
                                                                  

group of words, we must then determine where the second group ends. It
              ,                                                   .   

is quite evident that “came into his own” is joined to “suffered long,”
                      “                 ”              “             ,”

even though _coming into one’s own_ is no part of what constitutes a
                            ’                                       

hero. We simply accept the words at Balzac’s estimate.
    .                                     ’          .




The meaning of the next group, introduced by the second “and,” is
                             ,                          “   ,”   

unmistakable; and the group is coordinate in sense, and is connected
            ;                                     ,                 

by the conjunction, with all that precedes. If the group preceding
                  ,                       .                       

the conjunction is subdivided by a colon, even though the colon here
                                        ,                           

is not used solely because of its rank, it is well to ignore this
                                      ,                          

technicality, and use a period, thus unmistakably and properly grouping
            ,                 ,                                        

the language.
            .




This reasoning would give us the following punctuation:
                                                      :




  61-2. He was all that a hero should be: he suffered long, and came
    - .                                 :                 ,         

  into his own. And he has been, in a measure, the world’s ideal of a
              .                ,             ,          ’            

  heroic man of arms.
                    .




The period here connects the second sentence with _all_ of the
                                                              

preceding sentence, at once disconnecting the second sentence from
                  ,                                               

the second clause of the first sentence, of which it is made an
                                       ,                       

unmistakable part in the original sentence (No. 61).
                                           (  .   ).




This sentence illustrates the loose grouping common to many of our best
                                                                       

writers; and it also shows that marks of punctuation, if possessing
       ;                                            ,              

clearly understood meanings, cannot be adjusted to loose groupings.
                           ,                                      .







If the colon in No. 61-2 were considered like the colon in No. 25, and
                  .   -                                      .   ,    

thus held subordinate to the semicolon, a semicolon would be preferable
                                      ,                                

to the period that follows; yet very few readers would grasp such fine
                          ;                                           

use of a mark in a sentence like No. 61-2.
                                   .   - .







Our next sentence illustrates a fault that is practically the opposite
                                                                      

of the above; and its punctuation is much more common and even more
            ;                                                      

distracting. It is the fault of splitting up a sentence, making two
           .                                           ,           

sentences out of one, or of carrying a part of one sentence over into
                    ,                                                

another sentence, making two incomplete sentences. This fault grows out
                ,                                .                     

of an effort to use short sentences, which some writers think essential
                                   ,                                   

to clearness. It is quite safe to say few sentences are too long if
            .                                                      

the relations between their parts can clearly be shown by marks of

                  ,           ,             ,                       

  when engaged in litigation, they were generally honorable partisans.
                            ,                                        .




That the third of the above sentences grows out of the first is clearly
                                                                       

shown by the contrast between the kinds of lawyers mentioned: the
                                                            :    

former promoted _quarrels_; the latter were _peacemakers_. Note also
                          ;                              .          

that each class is qualified: the first is qualified by “but they were
                            :                           “             

the pariahs”; the second by “and were generally honorable partisans.”
           ”;               “                                      .”

The “and,” which introduces a really qualifying clause, might
    “   ,”                                            ,      

properly have been “but,” to show that as “peacemakers” these lawyers
                   “   ,”                 “           ”              

surrendered no rights of their clients, _but_ contended for such rights
                                      ,                                

when necessary to become “professional partisans.”
                         “                      .”




As the sentences are written, the third sentence does not grow out of
                            ,                                        

the sentence (the second) preceding it, but out of the first sentence;
             (          )             ,                              ;

and such remoteness of parts standing in the close relation required in
                                                                       

a contrast, is distracting.
          ,               .




We used a period in No. 61-2 because “and” there connects two complete
                      .   -          “   ”                            

sentences standing in the _and_ relation to each other. We object to
                                                      .             

the use of a period in No. 62 where the conjunction (but) connects two
                         .                          (   )             

sentences which are properly only one, and should be so written.
                                     ,                         .




The points we wish to make may be seen by a slight change in the
                                                                

sentence:
        :




  62-1. There were lawyers who promoted quarrels to get fees; but
    - .                                                     ;    

  they were the pariahs of the profession. The best lawyers were
                                         .                      

  peacemakers; but, when engaged in litigation and it became necessary,
             ;    ,                                                   ,

  they were professional partisans, though they were generally
                                  ,                           

  honorable partisans.
                     .




In order to see more clearly the differentiation between relations that
                                                                       

require the semicolon and those that require the colon, let us study
                                                      ,             

these relations in two sentences properly punctuated with each of the
                                                                     

two marks:
         :




  63. The only true equalizers in the world are books; the only
    .                                                ;         

  treasure-house open to all comers is a library; the only wealth which
          -                                     ;                      

  will not decay is knowledge.
                             .




  64. Here was a superintendent worth having: when he did not find good
    .                                       :                          

  tools, he made them.
       ,             .




Why not use commas or periods in No. 63? Why not use a semicolon in No.
                                   .   ?                              .

64?
  ?




Perhaps we have not made, and cannot make, the differentiation between
                        ,                ,                            

the comma and the semicolon sufficiently definite to answer the first
                                                                     

question, especially as the formation of each of the three clauses is
        ,                                                            

such that the liability to error in reading them is very slight. It
                                                               .   

would be rather dogmatic to assert that the use of commas here would
                                                                    

be poor punctuation; yet the degree of separation between the groups
                   ;                                                

is so marked as to make the relations more like the relations between
                                                                     

groups that we have seen to require a semicolon than like relations
                                                                   

between groups separated by a comma. The degree of separation here
                                   .                              

almost approaches the degree that takes the period; and therefore the
                                                  ;                  

semicolon seems much better than the comma.
                                          .




But why not periods? Two positive answers may be given. The three
                   ?                                  .          

clauses constitute one complete idea, and therefore make a sentence.
                                    ,                              .

If set off by periods, thus making three sentences, no fourth sentence
                     ,                            ,                   

could be formed to follow the third and maintain sentence unity; for
                                                               ;    

the fourth sentence would necessarily grow out of the third, while its
                                                           ,          

logical relation would be to the three clauses. Such a fault would be
                                              .                      

that seen in Sentence 62.
                        .




Why not a semicolon in No. 64? Because, under our classifications and
                         .   ?        ,                              

definitions, the colon, when its use is not determined by its rank, as
           ,          ,                                           ,   

it is in Sentence 6, is used to show a relation that is practically
                   ,                                               

that of apposition, exhibited, in different forms, in Sentences 25
                  ,          ,                   ,                

and 26-3. “A good superintendent” is explained by the expanded clause
      - . “                     ”                                    

following the colon, just as “articles” in No. 25 is explained by the
                   ,         “        ”      .                       

details that follow the colon.
                             .




In most sentences like No. 64 the second clause can be tied to the
                         .                                        

first by a conjunction (for, as, etc.); but the exact idea is not thus
                       (   ,   ,    .);                               

expressed. While this would sometimes show the sense relation between
         .                                                           

the clauses, it would distinctly weaken the force and beauty of the
           ,                                                       

language, tending to make the second clause a specific, rather than a
        ,                                             ,              

general, statement.
       ,          .




The differentiation between the semicolon and the colon in Nos. 63 and
                                                              .       

64 is very clear if we recognize the colon as the mark of apposition
                                                                    

or explanation. In No. 63 other clauses are added to the first to add
              .      .                                               

other thoughts; in No. 64 the added clause repeats the thought of the
              ;      .                                               

first by way of amplification of such thought.
                                             .




The greatest value of a mark of punctuation lies in its ability to
                                                                  

indicate a meaning that depends upon the relation of one group of words
                                                                       

to another; and so long as language has a literary value, just so
          ;                                             ,        

long will the colon be useful as an aid in the expression of thought.
                                                                    .

This is illustrated in our next sentence (No. 65), where a semicolon,
                                         (  .   ),                  ,

instead of the colon, would suggest the _and_ relation, and thus make
                    ,                                 ,              

havoc of the sense:
                  :




  65. Ethics has no summons to righteousness: it knows nothing of truth
    .                                       :                          

  spiritually discerned.
                       .




If a period were used here, instead of the colon, the relation between
                          ,                     ,                     

the two sentences (clauses formed into sentences by the use of the
                  (                                               

period) might easily be taken for the _and_ relation. With such
      )                                             .          

relation between the clauses, the first clause would make a vague
                            ,                                    

assertion, which, without an explanation, would convey no definite
         ,      ,                       ,                         

meaning.
       .




In our discussion of Sentence 6 we saw that the colon, preceding “but,”
                                                     ,           “   ,”

made the _but_ relation extend back over several clauses separated by
                                                                     

semicolons. “But” may begin a sentence, a paragraph, a part of a book,
          . “   ”                     ,            ,                 ,

or even a volume. When beginning any one of such groups, the _but_
                .                                      ,          

relation should be a well-defined sense relation between the groups
                         -                                         

so connected. If “but” begins a paragraph, the sense relation must be
            .    “   ”                   ,                           

between the two paragraphs connected by the conjunction. Such relation
                                                       .              

is rarely sustained between long paragraphs; and it does not exist
                                           ;                      

between sentences nearly so often as it is indicated by the use of the
                                                                      

conjunction and the period.
                          .




_But_, _and_, and _for_ are the principal conjunctions thus used,
     ,      ,                                                   ,

although others are not infrequently so used.
                                            .







COMMA AND SEMICOLON
                   




The differentiation of the semicolon from the colon, and the colon
                                                   ,              

from the period, seems to be so well marked that a choice between
               ,                                                 

them is rarely difficult to make in the punctuation of language with
                                                                    

proper sense relations between its parts; but the differentiation
                                        ;                        

between the comma and the semicolon is not so well defined, yet it
                                                          ,       

is generally very clear in well-written English. Here the choice of a
                               -               .                     

mark is determined, very largely, by the degree of separation between
                  ,             ,                                    

the groups. In order further to illustrate this point, let us compare
          .                                          ,               

No. 63 with a sentence which is quite like it, and yet requires only a
  .                                          ,                        

comma between its clauses:
                         :




  66. Experience is fallacious, and judgment difficult.
    .                         ,                       .




The first three words of the above form a clause which so completely
                                                                    

expresses a thought that the addition, by means of the “and,” of
                                     ,                 “   ,”   

another adjective to follow “fallacious,” is hardly suggested. On the
                            “          ,”                    .       

other hand, this degree of completeness might suggest that what is
          ,                                                       

to follow will be a complete clause so changing the direction of the
                                                                    

thought as to require a semicolon to show the fact of the change. Let
                                                                .    

us look at the sentence diagrammatically:
                                        :




  66-1. Experience is fallacious and....
    - .                             ....




How will this sentence probably continue? This question confronts every
                                        ?                              

intelligent reader, whether he realizes it or not, when reading the
                  ,                              ,                 

complete sentence. If the mark before “and,” or the absence of a mark,
                 .                    “   ,”                         ,

conveys to him no information upon this point, he learns only through
                                             ,                       

a tiresome mental process of ascertaining the correct relation of the
                                                                     

words that follow “and” to the words that precede it. This process
                  “   ”                             .             

is one of holding in suspense two or more possible combinations. It
                                                               .   

is always distractive, and very often ends in a wrong combination.
                     ,                                           .

A semicolon before “and” would suggest that the preceding group of
                   “   ”                                          

words is complete in itself, and is to be followed by a complete and
                           ,                                        

coördinate thought (“and” indicates the coordination) in the proper
                   (“   ”                           )              

sense relation with the group that has preceded. It would at once
                                               .                 

preclude the expectation of an adjective coördinate with “fallacious.”
                                                         “          .”




We may complete the sentence thus:
                                 :




  66-2. Experience is fallacious; and therefore it is difficult for us
    - .                         ;                                     

  to form correct judgments based upon experience.
                                                 .




To exhibit at once the sense relation between the two groups of words
                                                                     

in the above (the relation of correct judgment to experience), we
             (                                              ),   

inserted the word “therefore”; to show that “and” is to be followed by
                  “         ”;              “   ”                     

a group grammatically coördinate with what precedes it, and of like
                                                      ,            

form, we used a semicolon.
    ,                    .




If the relation between the groups were closer than the relation
                                                                

suggested by the semicolon, but not so close as indicated by the
                          ,                                     

absence of a mark, the comma would logically be the proper mark. It
                 ,                                             .   

would suggest neither a word to be grouped with “fallacious” nor a
                                                “          ”      

clause to be grouped with all that precedes “and.” It would suggest
                                            “   .”                 

a different development of the sentence. Such development would tie
                                       .                           

what follows to a _part_, not to the _whole_, of what precedes; and,
                        ,                   ,                 ;    ,

as there are but three words in this sentence preceding the mark, what
                                                                ,     

follows must be tied to one of them, and not to the whole, as in No.
                                   ,                     ,         .

66-2. Two sentences will serve to illustrate the point:
  - .                                                 :




  66-3. Experience is fallacious, and may not safely be depended upon
    - .                         ,                                    

  in the formation of correct judgment.
                                      .




  66-4. Experience is fallacious, and unreliable as a basis of correct
    - .                         ,                                     

  judgment.
          .




In No. 66-3 the comma notifies the reader that another adjective in the
     .   -                                                             

_and_ relation to “fallacious,” is not to follow.
                  “          ,”                 .




In No. 66-4 the comma is used to confine “as a basis of correct
     .   -                               “                     

judgment” to “unreliable,” thus disconnecting it from “fallacious.”
        ”    “          ,”                            “          .”

This makes the language say that experience is fallacious _in all
                                                                 

things_, and unreliable _only_ as a basis of correct judgment.
       ,                                                     .




If the reasoning in our discussion on the differentiation of the comma
                                                                      

from the semicolon, be correct, it seems to establish a rule that the
                  ,           ,                                      

semicolon is the mark of choice between two clauses, whether joined by
                                                   ,                  

a conjunction or not. It is not entirely the length or the character of
                    .                                                  

the groups of words that determines the choice. The liability to make
                                              .                      

wrong combinations, especially such combinations as are suggested by
                  ,                                                 

the apparent meaning of the language, is to be lessened by the mark.
                                    ,                              .




In the absence of a mark in Sentence 1, a momentary wrong combination
                                      ,                              

is quite unavoidable, because perfectly good sense is made by the wrong
                    ,                                                  

grouping. As a comma before “and” may not give to every reader notice
        .                   “   ”                                    

of the development of the sentence, and as a semicolon could hardly
                                  ,                                

fail to do so, it would seem to be the better mark.
             ,                                    .




In neither No. 66-3 nor No. 66-4 can the reader definitely interpret
             .   -        .   -                                     

the meaning of the comma until one or two words following the
                                                             

conjunction are reached. As the process of determining a relation from
                       .                                              

a mark often requires the reader to consider the mark and one or two
                                                                    

words following it, which process becomes almost instantaneous, a comma
                  ,                                           ,        

may thus convey its purpose as readily as the semicolon in No. 66-2
                                                             .   - 

tells its purpose.
                 .




A slight change in the language of Sentence 1 will not change either
                                                                    

the names of the two groups (clauses) or their relation (coordination);
                            (       )                   (            );

but it will remove the liability, even the possibility, of such wrong
                                ,                     ,              

combination as is suggested in Sentence 1:
                                         :




  66-5. Respect the rights of children and you will gain their respect.
    - .                                                               .




In this sentence, a mark before “and” is not really needed as a warning
                ,               “   ”                                  

to the reader not to connect “you” with “children,” thus making “you”
                             “   ”      “        ,”             “   ”

an object of the preposition “of.”
                             “  .”




The similarity in form between Nos. 1 and 66-5, with a mark of
                                  .         - ,               

punctuation imperative in the first, suggests the use of a mark in
                                   ,                              

the second. As the comma is here quite sufficient to prevent a wrong
          .                                                         

combination by the reader, the comma naturally becomes the mark of
                         ,                                        

choice; and good convention confirms this choice, while convention not
      ;                                         ,                     

so good seems to ignore the need of the semicolon in similarly formed
                                                                     

sentences in which the _apparent_ and _wrong_ grouping is much more
                                                                   

marked than in Sentence 1.
                         .




Sentences 66 and 66-5 stand at one extreme of the class of sentences in
                   -                                                   

the punctuation of which we seek to differentiate between the comma and
                                                                       

the semicolon. The relation is made quite unmistakable by the shortness
             .                                                         

and completeness of the first group of words, and also by the fact that
                                            ,                          

the word in each sentence following the conjunction does not suggest,
                                                                    ,

even in the slightest degree, a connection for itself with anything
                            ,                                      

that precedes.
             .




Let us consider a sentence at the other extreme, where a wrong
                                               ,              

combination is wholly unavoidable without a semicolon, and quite
                                                     ,          

suggestive with one:
                   :




  66-6. I do not mean that the people are conscious of this fact; but
    - .                                                         ;    

  that the leaders of the people are conscious of it, I think, there is
                                                    ,        ,         

  no doubt.
          .




In this sentence a semicolon is quite indispensable in order to
                                                               

disconnect the second group beginning with “that” from “mean,” to which
                                           “    ”      “    ,”

Between these extremes are many sentences which may take either the

  The comma before “and” in No. 12 divides the _semicolon_ group into
                   “   ”      .

  “Die hard, and you won’t die at all” is really a bull; and the
  “        ,            ’            ”                 ;        

  incongruity of ideas might well be expressed by a dash before “and.”

worse, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful

14. All religions, even the most conservative and traditional, are in

  The above sentence is thus punctuated in the Enclycopedia Britannica
                                                                      

  and the New Standard Dictionary. We know of no meaning of the comma
                                 .                                   

  that indicates the real sense relation between “in constant flux”
                                                 “                ”

  and what follows. Nor is this relation that shown by the colon; for
                  .                                             ;    

  a thing,—for instance, the ocean,—may be _in constant flux_, and yet
         ,—            ,          ,—                         ,        

  not either _advance_ or _decay_.
                                 .




  The meaning of the language requires “and” after “flux,” preferably
                                       “   ”       “    ,”           

  with a semicolon before it.

  In the above example the _semicolon_ relation does not exist between

  thought. Moreover, the third group bears an unmistakable relation to
         .         ,                                                  

  the second group; and such relation is not the _period_ relation. The

  As the third sentence in the above example does not grow out of the

  In this example sentence unity is wholly disregarded: the first

                       ,                     ,                       

  punctuation we have discussed.
                               .




  As now punctuated, the second sentence does not grow out of the
                   ,                                             

  first, but out of the first half of the first; and the third
       ,                                       ;              

  sentence, instead of growing out of the second, grows out of the
          ,                                     ,                 

  second half of the first, ignoring the second sentence entirely.
                          ,                                      .




  Uniting the second and third sentences by a semicolon will improve
                                                                    

  the grouping and the punctuation; but making one sentence out of the
                                  ;                                   

  three is still better:

  The relations between the groups may be shown in another way; but

  such mode of expressing thought is not tolerable:

COMMA, DASH, AND PARENTHESES

THEIR DIFFERENTIATION
                     







We know of no writer who has attempted to differentiate the above
                                                                 

marks; but some writers have dismissed the subject by saying that these
     ;                                                                 

marks are interchangeable. Such a statement, we believe, is merely a
                         .                 ,           ,            

confession of failure to comprehend the inherent meanings of the marks,
                                                                      ,

and the need of giving marks definite meanings. The confusion resulting
                                              .                        

from such failure is, at least at this point, chaos in punctuation and,
                    ,                       ,                         ,

not infrequently, in the meaning of language so punctuated.
                ,                                         .




Mr. Garrison,[7] in his able _Atlantic_ article, says: “Dash, comma,
  .         ,[ ]                               ,     : “    ,      ,

and parenthesis have equal title to employment in this sentence of
                                                                  

Thackeray’s.” The following is the sentence punctuated in the three
         ’ .”                                                      

ways recognized by Mr. Garrison as correct punctuation:
                     .                                :




  67. If that theory be, and I have no doubt it is, the right and safe
    .                  ,                          ,                   

  one.
     .




  67-1. If that theory be (and I have no doubt it is) the right and
    - .                   (                         )              

  safe one.
          .




  67-2. If that theory be—and I have no doubt it is—the right and safe
    - .                  —                         —                  

  one.
     .




Let us first ask why any mark is required before “and” in the sentence,
                                                 “   ”                ,

and then what the mark, if used, says to the writer. When the reader
                      ,        ,                   .                

reaches the conjunction, two questions at once confront him: First,
                       ,                                   :      ,

does “and” connect the words between which it immediately stands?
     “   ”                                                      ?

second, does “and” carry the _if_ meaning over to the second group of
      ,      “   ”                                                   

words? As “and” does not connect the words between which it immediately
     ?    “   ”                                                        

stands, some mark is suggested; and that mark is the comma, but a comma
      ,                       ;                           ,            

may not clearly exclude _if_ from the second group. If the _if_ meaning
                                                  .                    

is not to be conveyed, a larger grouping is suggested; and this would
                     ,                               ;               

call for a semicolon, which would _more widely_ separate parts (subject
                    ,                                          (       

and predicate) of the whole sentence which should be held together.
             )                                                    .




The _and_ relation is here what we may call a strained one; in fact,
                                                          ;        ,

the _and_ relation hardly exists in this sentence.
                                                 .




The punctuation of No. 67-1 is all right if we accept a meaning of
                     .   -                                        

the term _parenthesis_ that will cover the group of words we are here
                                                                     

dealing with; but the punctuation is wholly wrong if we use marks
            ;                                                    

according to fundamental principles. Both the New International and the
                                   .                                   

New Standard dictionaries give definitions of a parenthesis that are
                                                                    

incomplete and misleading. Their definitions are almost identical in
                         .

             ,                       ,             ,                 

inserted, for explanation or qualification, “in a sentence which would
        ,                                 , “                         

be grammatically complete without it.” This definition ignores both the
                                    .”                                 

root meaning of the word and the common usage of the parenthesis. It is
                                                                .      

an excellent definition for an _explanatory_ word or group of words,
                                                                   ,

except a complete explanatory sentence, which we set off by commas, as
                                      ,                           ,   

shown in our discussion of Sentence 11 _et seq._ We do not know what
                                              .                     

would become, under this definition, of a parenthesis in the form of
            ,                      ,                                

a complete sentence; for the definition confines the parenthesis to a
                   ;                                                 

word or words inserted _in a sentence_.
                                      .




The Century gives a definition that is based upon the Greek roots
                                                                 

of the word _parenthesis_, as well as upon its use by good writers.
                         ,                                        .

According to this definition, a parenthesis has _no grammatical_
                            ,                                   

relation with the language into which it is “put.” (The word _thrust_
                                            “   .” (                 

would perhaps give a clearer idea of the original.) We “parenthesize”
                                                 .)    “            ”

in spoken, as well as in written or printed, language; but in the
         ,                                 ,         ;           

former we convey the meaning by inflections and pauses, while in the
                                                      ,             

latter we convey the meaning by marks of punctuation.
                                                    .




The use of the conjunction (and) in the sentence under consideration
                           (   )                                    

clearly takes the inserted group of words out of the proper definition
                                                                      

of a parenthesis; for it puts such words into _grammatical_ connection
                ;                                                     

with what precedes, although the words are quite strongly parenthetical
                  ,                                                    

in nature.
         .




Now, having eliminated the comma, the semicolon, and the parentheses as
   ,                            ,              ,                       

the proper marks for setting off this group of words _thrust_ into the
                                                                      

sentence, and still making good sense by their grammatical connection,
        ,                                                            ,

how shall we punctuate them? It is perfectly evident that this group of
                           ?                                           

words makes a decided _break_ in the thread of the thought, and that
                                                          ,         

they do not have logical or natural connection with what precedes,
                                                                 ,

because the true _and_ relation does not exist between the thoughts,
                                                                   ,

implied or expressed. Such language may be said to be idiomatic and
                    .                                              

therefore proper; but the group of words is not properly set off in
                ;                                                  

either No. 67 or No. 67-1. As the fundamental use of the dash is to
         .         .   - .                                         

note such a break in language as here occurs, it is the proper mark
                                            ,                      

before “and” in this sentence. In language of this kind it may be said
       “   ”                 .                                        

that the writer _dashes_ off the track of his thought for a moment; and
                                                                  ;    

therefore the dash is the proper mark to indicate such a break in the
                                                                     

continuity of thought.
                     .




The second dash is used to close the group in the same way that the
                                                                   

second comma of a pair of commas, or the second part of the marks
                                ,                                

of parenthesis, is used; and this makes the punctuation of No. 67-2
              ,        ;                                     .   - 

correct punctuation, for it is based upon the fundamental meanings of
                   ,                                                 

both the marks and the sense relations of the words.
                                                   .




This careless use of the marks of parenthesis, especially as in No.
                                             ,                    .

67-1, is quite common in some literary periodicals of high standing and
  - ,                                                                  

in not a few large printing establishments; but, we venture to assert,
                                          ;    ,                     ,

it is rare among painstaking writers who punctuate their own writings.

Such use of marks utterly prevents a differentiation between commas

such fundamental differences in meanings as exists between the words

Let us also note that groups of words defined in Chapter III as

thought, so that Sentence 67 is not at all similar to such sentences
       ,

statement, let us compare Sentence 67 with Sentence 10-2. If the _and_

would not make sense.
                    .




If it is not now clear that the punctuation of Nos. 67 and 67-1
                                                  .          -

Mr. Teall does not go quite so far as Mr. Garrison, who puts the
  .                                     .         ,

punctuation of Sentence 67. Mr. Teall, however, makes the following

choice between commas and parentheses, so also there is none between
                                     ,

statement, but not the former. His illustrative example is a sentence
         ,                   .

             .       ’      ,               ,        ,                

the parentheses or the dashes. We give the sentence (No. 68) as
                             .                      (  .   )   

punctuated by Mr. Wilson:
                .       :

    .                                 (

                  ),                                         .




Mr. Teall evidently agrees with Mr. Wilson in the punctuation of the
  .                               .                                 

sentence, which, he says, may as well take dashes; but he expresses no
        ,      ,        ,                        ;                    

choice between the two modes of punctuation.
                                           .




We have already said that this punctuation violates fundamental
                                                               

principles; and that it does so is evidenced by Mr. Wilson’s
          ;                                       .       ’ 

definitions. In one place (page 168) he defines a parenthesis as “words
           .              (        )                             “

                                            ”;                     

page he says a parenthesis is “an expression inserted in the body
                              “

            .”   .                                               .




The meaning of “obliquely thrown into” is, we think, unmistakable.
               “                     ”   ,         ,             .

It is equivalent to “thrust into,” and characterizes matter that is
                    “           ,”                                 

“without grammatical connection.”
“                              .”




It does not seem to us true that the parenthesis (group of words) in
                                                 (              )   

No. 68 has “no connection in sense” with the sentence. As “and” gives
  .        “                      ”                  .    “   ”      

it constructive connection, why does “and” not give it sense relation?
                          ,          “   ”                           ?

and why is “and” used, what does it mean, and what does it connect?
           “   ”     ,                  ,                         ?




The punctuation of No. 67-2 seems to us to be in accord with the
                     .   -

differentiates the dash from the two other marks. These principles are
                                                .

                                 .   ,                      .







COMMAS AND PARENTHESES
                      




The differentiation of the comma, or commas, from parentheses, is the

An excellent illustration of such erroneous definitions of a

DASHES AND PARENTHESES
                      




The indiscriminate substitution of dashes and parentheses for commas,

which is quite common in some literary periodicals and in some books

of marks; for there can be no differentiation between the marks so
        ;

    ,    ,             ,

The occasional substitution of parentheses for commas, where the use

This punctuation seems to throw the four nouns following the colon into

“        ”;

                                      .




For the sake of clearness, which is a chief object of punctuation,
                         ,                                       ,

of study should be shown by the punctuation. As “electrons” are “the
                                           .    “         ”     “   

smallest components of matter,” the punctuation should reveal the fact:
                             ,”                                       :

By reserving dashes for the large groups of words which are purely
                                                                  

parenthetical in nature, but are tied to what precedes by a connective,

generally a conjunction or a preposition, we do not violate the
                                        ,                      

fundamental meaning of either the dash or the marks of parenthesis;
                                                                  ;

and therefore when we meet either mark its meaning is unmistakable. In
                                                                  .   

short, we do not make a mark serve an additional and unnecessary use,
     ,                                                              ,

and so render it more difficult to interpret as a sign-board.
                                                      -     .




When we speak of the “fundamental” meaning of a mark, we refer to the
                     “           ”                  ,                

meaning implied in its name, the name, of course, being descriptive of
                           ,         ,          ,                     

a feature of the language which is to be pointed out by the mark. The
                                                                .    

word _dash_, as has already been said, points out that the writer has
           ,                         ,                               

_dashed_ aside, as it were, in his line of thought, and is going to
              ,           ,                       ,                

“parenthesize” something, keeping his thought, however, _grammatically_
“            ”          ,                    ,        ,                

connected with what precedes. We violate this principle in the use
                            .                                     

of the single dash exemplified in Sentence 33, just as we violate a
                                             ,                     

fundamental principle in the use of the parentheses in No. 70-1. We

think there is no objection to the former use of the dash; for it
                                                         ;       

serves a good purpose, and its meaning can hardly be mistaken. The
                     ,                                       .    

relation indicated by the comma and dash is suggested before the mark
                                                                     

is reached, as, in Sentence 33, details are suggested by the words
          ,   ,               ,                                   

“three original parties.”
“                      .”




The indiscriminate use of dashes and parentheses for commas has
                                                               

become quite common; but, after a very careful study of language thus
                   ;    ,                                            

punctuated, we can find no justification or excuse for such usage.
          ,                                                      .

It may give the writer a choice of marks, but it gives no light to
                                        ,                         

the reader. It is too much like using either red or yellow for a
          .                                                     

danger-signal when red better answers the purpose.
      -                                          .




Although the differentiation between commas and parentheses is at times
                                                                       

somewhat difficult, generally it is very easy. The following sentences
                  ,                          .                        

will illustrate common uses of the marks where the shades of meaning
                                                                    

are nice, but unmistakable:
        ,                 :




  72. Ian Maclaren (Dr. John Watson) wrote “Beside the Bonnie Briar
    .              (  .            )       “                       

  Bush.”
      .”




  73. Ian Maclaren, a noted Scotch minister (Dr. John Watson), is the
    .             ,                         (  .            ),       

  author of “Beside the Bonnie Briar Bush.”
            “                            .”




  74. Ian Maclaren (the pen-name of Dr. John Watson) is unmistakably
    .              (       -          .            )                

  Scotch.
        .




In No. 72 “Dr. John Watson” is purely parenthetical matter, used to
     .    “  .            ”                               ,        

give the reader some information about the _name_ of the man already
                                                                    

mentioned. As we have been talking about the man, the information about
         .                                      ,                      

his name is like an aside,—that is, it is purely parenthetical. This
                         ,—       ,                           .     

matter may be omitted without affecting the sense of the language in
                                                                    

any manner; and, as it is purely parenthetical, it properly takes the
          ;    ,                              ,                      

marks of parenthesis.
                    .




In No. 73 we have both an explanatory group of words and a parenthesis.
     .                                                                .

The first is equivalent to “who is a noted Scotch minister.” In
                           “                              .”   

either form it is an essential part of the information the writer
                                                                 

wishes to convey. We have already defined such a group as _slightly
                .                                                  

parenthetical_, to be set off by commas.
              ,                        .




No. 74 is a particularly distractive sentence, although its punctuation
  .                                          ,                         

may be technically correct. The first picture given in this sentence to
                          .                                            

the reader is that of a man; the next one, given by the parenthesis, is
                           ;             ,                         ,   

that of a name. A third thought follows; and this thought is applicable
              .                        ;                               

to either a _man_ or a _name_. As “Watson” is an Irish name, the
                             .    “      ”                 ,    

question may arise in reading No. 74 whether the writer wishes to say
                                .                                    

“Ian Maclaren,” the _man_, is Scotch, or “Ian Maclaren,” the _name_, is
“            ,”          ,          ,    “            ,”           ,   

Scotch.
      .




There is a conventional way of writing a name of this kind to show
                                                                  

that the name is referred to merely as a word. This is done by the use
                                             .                        

of italics or quotation-marks; and therefore to avoid the distractive
                       -     ;                                       

effect of No. 74, it may be written thus:
            .   ,                       :




  74-1. _Ian Maclaren_ (the pen-name of Dr. John Watson) is
    - .                (       -          .            )   

  unmistakably Scotch.
                     .




Here the italics notify the reader that he is to consider the name,
                                                                  ,

not the person named; and this name is a Scotch word.
                    ;                               .




Like notice would be given by the use of quotation-marks in place of
                                                  -                 

the italics.
           .




The distractive effect caused by producing two impressions through a
                                                                    

wrong use of marks of parenthesis, should be avoided.
                                 ,                  .







EXAMPLES
        




1. I am a lady, and a coward.

2. I am a lady and—a coward.
 .                —        .




  In No. 1 the comma makes “a coward” an afterthought. In No. 2 the
       .                   “        ”                .      .      

  dash shows a hesitancy on the part of the writer about calling

  between the two sentences is clearly marked.

3. On these occasions I have been grateful to the happy accident, or

      ,                                          .




4. On these occasions I have been grateful to the happy accident—or
 .                                                              —  

design?—that made me a participant in such scenes.
      ?—                                         .




  In No. 3 the commas indicate an afterthought; in No. 4 the writer
       .                                      ;      .             

  makes an aside, as if asking someone a question, thus requiring a
                ,                                ,

6. The following sentence contains three nouns: Do (1) good by (2)
 .                                            :    ( )         ( )

stealth, and blush to find it (3) fame.
       ,                      ( )     .




7. She walked away, a very straight, beautiful—yes, certainly
 .                ,                ,          —   ,          

beautiful—young figure, and disappeared.

at large,—a very natural thing.
        ,—                    .




  In No. 8 the second group is a mere appositive or definition of the
       .                                                             

  first; but the third group is a restatement of the thought implied in
       ;                                                               

  the two preceding groups. The comma shows the relation; the dash does
                          .                             ;

  The consideration of the use of the dash in No. 12 does not strictly

  appearance of an aside with grammatical connection (apposition) with

  what precedes. “As we may” is equivalent to “in any manner”; and the

     “         ,”                                       ,

  Why not use marks of parentheses in No. 13, instead of dashes? The

  reason lies in the meaning of the former marks. If “matter” or

  “little masses of matter” were an obscure term requiring explanation,
  “                       ”                                           ,

  the explanatory term would properly take the form of a parenthesis;
                                                                    ;

  NOTE.—We do not think that “oh” is often written with a

sentences do not mean the same.

Sentence No. 75 says that the grape is a large one in the class of
           .                                                      

_wild grapes_, confining the comparison to wild grapes.
             ,                                        .




Sentence No. 75-1 says that the grape is large and is wild. It is large
           .   -                                          .

                                      .




In No. 75 we give the language its natural meaning. In No. 75-1 we use
     .                                            .      .   -        

a comma to show that the natural meaning is not the meaning we wish to
                                                                      

convey; we disconnect “large” from “wild grape,” as, in Sentence 1-1,
      ;               “     ”      “          ,”   ,              - ,

we disconnected words standing in an _apparent_ relation which was not
                                                                      

the _real_ relation.
                   .




Other examples at the end of this chapter will further illustrate the
                                                                     

punctuation.

DOUBLE OBJECT
             




We have already seen that nouns standing together require some mark
                                                                   

between them if their apparent relation is not their real relation.
                                                                  .

This principle was illustrated especially in Sentence 8-1.
                                                       - .




The so-called double object furnishes an apparent exception to the
      -                                                           

principle. The relation, however, between such words is as regular as
         .             ,        ,                                    

the relation between an adjective and a noun when the former precedes
                                                                     

the latter. Thus the following sentence requires no mark between the
          .                                                         

nouns constituting a so-called double object:
                       -                    :




  76. They elected John Smith president.
    .                                  .




A similar relation is seen when the first noun in a sentence like the
                                                                     

above is followed by an adjective. The relation is regular, and calls
                                 .                        ,          

for no mark:
           :




  76-1. They called John Smith wise.
    - .                            .




In some cases the relation may be more idiomatic than regular, the
                                                             ,    

mark being omitted because there is no real need for its use. The next
                                                            .         

sentence exhibits such relationship:
                                   :




  77. I myself will undertake the work.
    .                                 .







A “LONG” SUBJECT
  “    ”        




When a subject is composed of two or more words, and these words do
                                               ,                   

not readily group themselves, a comma may be helpful to group them
                            ,                                     

as a subject. This failure of words to fall readily into a group is
            .                                                      

generally due to one of three causes: the subject may be somewhat long
                                    :                                 

and contain marks of punctuation, or it may end with a word that seems
                                ,                                     

itself to sustain grammatical and sense relation with the word or words
                                                                       

following it, or it may end with a verb. In either of such cases the
            ,                          .                            

comma serves to show the end of the subject; and its use is therefore
                                           ;                         

helpful punctuation:
                   :




  78. Whatever is, is right.
    .            ,         .




  79. He that sees a building as a common spectator, contents himself
    .                                              ,                 

  with speaking of it in the most general terms.
                                               .




The use of the comma after “spectator” simply warns the reader that
                           “         ”                             

“the spectator contents himself” is not the meaning of the language
“                              ”                                   

at this point. The comma disconnects “spectator” and “contents,” just
             .                       “         ”     “        ,”     

as the comma disconnects certain words in Sentence 1-1. Thus the
                                                    - .         

punctuation of this sentence depends upon the fundamental principle of
                                                                      

_grouping_ and _disjunction_.
                            .




This principle also explains the value of a comma at the end of several
                                                                       

subject-nouns not connected by a conjunction:
       -                                    :




  80. Ease, indulgence, luxury, sloth, are the sources of misery.
    .     ,           ,       ,      ,                          .




With the conjunction “and” before “sloth,” the comma after “sloth”
                     “   ”        “     ,”                 “     ”

would not be needed, as “and” and the comma before it would give notice
                   ,    “   ”                                          

of the ending of the group.
                          .




The value of a comma in No. 79 is unmistakable; but is such punctuation
                          .                   ;                        

helpful when the subject clearly ends itself, either because of its
                                            ,                      

manifest completeness or because there is no apparent relation between
                                                                      

the last word of the subject and the predicate verb? Probably a
                                                   ?           

definite and satisfactory answer to this question cannot be given, for
                                                                 ,    

the mental capacity and alertness of the reader are involved.
                                                            .

It is not wise to make the meaning of language, especially in important

  unresponsive to them.
                      .




The comma after “aspirations” is used to disconnect the two groups
                “           ”                                     

of words between which it stands, thus breaking up an apparent group
                                ,                                   

(so noble in its aspirations as to furnish the right conditions for

these finer promptings), and forming out of it two groups, each of
                      ),                                 ,        

which begins with “so,” each group having for its complement the group
                  “  ,”                                               

beginning with “as.”
               “  .”




We perhaps may not say that the comma after “aspirations” at once gives
                                            “           ”              

notice of the relation of each of the preceding groups to what follows;
                                                                      ;

but, when the comma cuts “as” off from the preceding “so,” it shows
   ,                     “  ”                        “  ,”         

that “as” introduces a group completing each of the preceding groups
     “  ”                                                           

introduced by “so.” This disconnection between the last two groups
              “  .”                                               

compels the reader to make the new grouping.
                                           .




In the second of the larger groups of this sentence occurs a somewhat
                                                                     

similar grouping made by “so—as.” Here the comma is used, just as
                         “  —  .”                       ,        

it is used in Sentence 80, to mark the end of the first part of the

group. Its use in both clauses may be said to follow the punctuation
     .                                                              

diagrammatically exhibited in Sentence 3-2. In No. 82 the reader
                                        - .      .              

suspends the thought partially expressed by “so pure” until he
                                            “       ”         

reaches the complementary group of words beginning with “as.” This
                                                        “  .”     

process of suspending the thought occurs in this clause after each
                                                                  

group introduced by “so.” The process, instead of being difficult, is
                    “  .”            ,                           ,   

well-nigh intuitive, for “so” naturally raises the expectation of
    -              ,     “  ”                                    

the correlative “as,” which introduces the complement of each group
                “  ,”                                              

introduced by “so.”
              “  .”




Let us also note the last grouping in this sentence, where “to them” is
                                                   ,       “       ”   

tied to each of the three preceding adjectives by the grouping _ands_,
                                                                     ,

thus requiring no mark after the last adjective.
                                               .







INTERMEDIATE RESTRICTIVE GROUPS
                               




Probably at no other point in punctuation do writers obscure the
                                                                

meaning of language so much as in dealing with _restrictive_ and
                                                                

_explanatory_ groups of words. We dealt with the subject in Chapter
                             .                                     

III, but passed over one feature of it,—namely, the intermediate
   ,                                  ,—      ,                 

restrictive group, or a restrictive group coming between two other
                 ,                                                

groups closely tied together in sense, and seemingly requiring the
                                     ,                            

suspension of the intermediate group by commas.
                                              .




Before dealing with these groups, let us consider an interesting
                                ,                               

sentence, from very high authority, which tends to confirm our
        ,                         ,                           

statement concerning the importance of properly punctuating restrictive
                                                                       

and explanatory modifiers. The sentence is from a passage in Dean
                         .                                       

Alford’s notable book, “A Plea for the Queen’s English,” in which
      ’              , “                    ’         ,”         

passage the Dean severely scolds compositors for their bad punctuation,
                                                                      ,

particularly for the insertion of commas “without the slightest
                                         “                     

compunction.”
           .”




  83. I have some satisfaction in reflecting, that, in the course
    .                                       ,     ,              

  of editing the Greek text of the New Testament, I believe I have
                                                ,                 

  destroyed more than a thousand commas, which prevented the text being
                                       ,                               

  properly understood.
                     .




Mr. De Vinne quotes the passage in which this sentence appears; and
  .                                                           ;    

he does so in apparent approval of Dean Alford’s condemnation of the
                                              ’                     

misuse of commas. Mr. De Vinne makes a single comment upon the passage,
                .   .                                                 ,

in which he says “the last comma in this extract is superfluous.” The
                 “                                             .”    

reference is to the comma before “which.”
                                 “     .”




The comma before “which” is not simply “superfluous”: it is wrong. It
                 “     ”               “           ”:            .   

is _wrong_ because it changes the meaning of the language by making
                                                                   

the writer say, apparently, that he destroyed _all_ the commas in the
              ,           ,                                          

text, while he, unquestionably, intended to say he destroyed more than
    ,         ,               ,                                       

a thousand _offending_ commas, that is, commas _that_ (which) _obscured
                             ,        ,               (     )          

the text_.
         .




The superfluous comma in the above sentence is, in our opinion,
                                              ,               ,

the one after “reflecting.” This comma is used in accordance with
              “          .”                                      

the convention of Dean Alford’s day, and follows a rule of “close”
                             ’     ,                       “     ”

punctuation.
           .




But the punctuation is very bad at another point; and, we venture to
                                                ;    ,              

say, in spite of the great distinction of its author as an English
   ,                                                              

scholar, the language at this point is not the “Queen’s English.”
       ,                                       “     ’         .”

Omitting the intermediate and final groups of words, and the
                                                   ,        

superfluous comma, the sentence will read as follows:
                 ,                                  :




  83-1. I have some satisfaction in reflecting that I believe I have
    - .                                                             

  destroyed more than a thousand commas.
                                       .




“Satisfaction in reflecting _that I believe_,” is, to say the least,
“                                           ,”   ,                 ,

a curious satisfaction. This is not the meaning the writer wished to
                      .                                             

convey.
      .




The obvious error cannot be mended by setting “I believe” off with
                                              “         ”         

commas, for this would simply throw doubt upon the statement which
      ,                                                           

follows (I have destroyed), which is a positive statement, needing no
        (                ),                              ,           

qualification. The only doubtful assertion in the sentence is as to
             .                                                     

the _number_ of commas destroyed. The evident meaning of the language
                                .                                    

is, that the number of commas destroyed is _probably_ (I believe) more
  ,                                                   (         )     

than a thousand. To be sure, “probably” and “I believe” are not exactly
               .           , “        ”     “         ”                

equivalent terms; but the word _probably_ here serves to show how “I
                ;                                                 “ 

believe” is used. We set it off by commas because of its slightly
       ”        .                                                

parenthetical character.
                       .




The entire sentence should be written thus:
                                          :




  83-2. I have some satisfaction in reflecting that, in the course of
    - .                                            ,

                                             ,                 ,  

  believe, more than a thousand commas which prevented the text being
         ,                                                           

  properly understood.
                     .




The absence of a comma before the _adjective_ group of words
                                                            

beginning with “which,” tells the reader that such adjective group is
               “     ,”                                              

_restrictive_, thus confining the destruction to _harmful_ commas.
             ,                                                   .




Let us turn aside again to ask why, in the sentence above and
                                  ,                          

beginning with “The evident,” “probably” takes no commas, while a
               “           ,” “        ”                ,        

similar expression (I believe) in No. 83-2 requires them. “Probably”
                   (         )      .   -               . “        ”

here requires no commas because it coalesces with “more”; while “I
                                                  “    ”;       “ 

believe” does not do so, but makes a decided break in the smoothness
       ”               ,                                            

of the sentence. The latter expression is like an aside, thus becoming
               .                                       ,              

slightly parenthetical. The use of commas with “probably” would make
                      .                        “        ”           

“probably” more emphatic, because the pauses thus indicated would call
“        ”              ,                                             

special attention to it. Such use is good punctuation.
                       .                             .




We will now turn to a restrictive group of words that comes between
                                                                   

two other groups closely connected in meaning.
                                             .




Mr. Wilson treats this subject at length, but, we think, in an
  .                                     ,    ,         ,

than his discussion of the subject. As we do not desire to consider the
                                  .                                    

subject-matter of Mr. Wilson’s rule, we make up a sentence modeled upon
       -            .       ’      ,                                   

its language:
            :




  84. When books, that have been thoroughly examined and unqualifiedly
    .           ,                                                     

  approved by a board of college professors, are recommended by a
                                           ,

         ,                                          .




The adjective group of words following “books” is restrictive. It is
                                       “     ”               .      

perhaps made more clearly so by the use of a pronoun (that) formerly
                                                     (    )         

used, in the place of _who_ or _which_, to introduce a _restrictive_
    ,                                 ,                             

adjective in the form of a pronominal group of words.
                                                    .




If “which” be substituted for “that” in this sentence, the restrictive
   “     ”                    “    ”                 ,                

character of the group may not be so readily apparent; but this would
                                                     ;               

not change the punctuation recommended by Mr. Wilson. Let us deal with
                                            .       .                 

the sentence in this form:
                         :




  84-1. When books, which have been thoroughly examined and
    - .           ,                                        

  unqualifiedly approved by a board of college professors, are
                                                         ,

                          ,                                          .




If it is deemed helpful punctuation to set off by commas the group
                                                                  

of words between “books” and “are,” in order to show clearly the
                 “     ”     “   ,”                             

dependence of “books” upon “are recommended,” then commas are
              “     ”      “               ,”                

required. If, on the other hand, we wish to show by the punctuation
        .   ,                  ,                                   

that the group of words following “books” is restrictive, we must
                                  “     ”               ,        

omit the comma after “books.” Thus, apparently, we must here make a

quite like a rule that calls for a comma before a restrictive group of

The sentence may be written without a comma after “books,” but with one

after “professors.” The use of the latter would follow the punctuation
      “          .”

sentences. No. 84 may be recast in several ways; but it is difficult,
         .   .                                 ;                    ,

without introducing a new word, clearly to express the fact that _one
                              ,                                      

kind_ of books is meant, as shown in the restrictive adjective in both
                       ,                                              

Nos. 84 and 84-1.

We suggest the following form for the recast sentence:
                                                     :




  84-2. When _certain_ books have been thoroughly examined and
    - .

                                                         ,         

  been recommended by a teacher, her pupils should not refuse to read
                               ,                                     

  them.
      .




Every restrictive word or group of words confines the meaning of the
                                                                    

word or words so modified to a _certain_ thing or _certain_ things.
                                                                  .

The man _who was here yesterday_ means a _certain_ man, and means so
                                                      ,             

because of the restrictive group of words following “man”; but “the
                                                    “   ”;     “   

man, _who was here yesterday_,” is not so designated by the same group
   ,                         ,”

NOT—BUT
   —   




The punctuation of intermediate groups of words gives rise to a
                                                               

peculiar phraseology, which needs explanation. We have seen that the
                    ,                        .                      

intermediate group is set off by commas to show that the sense is
                                                                 

suspended at the point where the first comma is placed, to be continued
                                                      ,                

by connection with what follows the complementary comma. We illustrated
                                                       .               

this process diagrammatically in Sentence 4-3 by actually suspending on
                                           -                           

the printed page the intermediate group.
                                       .




We do not hesitate to use commas in the following sentence:
                                                          :




  85. His success was attained, not by ability and enterprise, but by
    .                         ,                              ,       

  friendly assistance.
                     .




If we suspend or omit the intermediate group in the above we obtain a
                                                                     

result which is not a good sentence:
                                   :




  85-1. His success was attained but by friendly assistance.
    - .                                                    .




We can say of such language as that of No. 85 only that it is
                                         .                   

_idiomatic_, thus justifying it as we justify the grammatical solecism
           ,                                                          

“_than whom_.”
“           .”




Mr. Wilson makes an exception to this mode of punctuation that is very
  .                                                                   

perplexing; and it is probably because of this that few, if any, other
          ;                                            ,       ,      

writers refer to or deal with it.
                                .




We shall not attempt to discuss Mr. Wilson’s rule, but let us consider
                                  .       ’      ,                    

one of his examples:
                   :




  86. It _is not_ from wild beasts, but from untamed passions, that the
    .                             ,                          ,         

  greatest evils arise to human society.
                                       .




We think the omission of a comma after “is,” thus suspending the
                                       “  ,”                    

negative group beginning with “not,” is justified, if at all, by the
                              “   ,”             ,          ,       

fact that such a sentence is usually read without a pause after the
                                                                   

verb; in other words, the language thus readily groups itself, and
    ;               ,                                        ,    

shows the meaning and the force of the negative intermediate group.
                                                                  .




Not a few good writers use a comma before “not” in sentences like No.
                                          “   ”                     .

86.
  .




If one or more words intervene between the verb and the negative
                                                                

particle, the parts of the sentence do not coalesce, and the comma is
        ,                                          ,                 

required.
        .




  87. He came not to teach, but to be taught.
    .                     ,                 .




  87-1. He came here, not to teach, but to be taught.
    - .             ,             ,                 .




If we change the form of No. 87, we may perhaps see somewhat more
                           .   ,                                 

clearly why this grouping is more natural than would be a grouping made
                                                                       

by a comma after the verb (came):
                          (    ):




  87-2. He did not come to teach, but to be taught.
    - .                         ,                 .




No. 87-2 seems to show that the grouping made by the comma in No. 87 is
  .   -                                                         .      

a natural grouping.
                  .




In spite of Mr. Wilson’s rule, and of our reasoning to explain it,
              .       ’      ,                                   ,

we believe that each mode of punctuating the following sentence is
                                                                  

correct, each depending upon where the emphasis is to be laid:
       ,                                                     :




  88. The book’s primary aim is, not to convince the skeptic, but to
    .         ’                ,                            ,

                                    -            .




  88-1. The book’s primary aim is not to convince the skeptic, but to
    - .         ’                                            ,       

  solve the difficulties of the best-thinking men.
                                    -            .




In No. 88 the emphasis is placed upon “to solve the difficulties,”
     .                                “                         ,”

the preceding group being thrown in for contrast, thus heightening the
                                                ,                     

effect of the statement made in the next group of words.
                                                       .




In No. 88-1 the emphasis falls upon “not to convince the skeptic,”
     .   -                          “                           ,”

just as it would if written, “It is not the book’s aim to convince the
                           , “                  ’                     

skeptic.”
       .”




Let us note carefully that the mode of punctuation in each of the two
                                                                     

preceding sentences would grow out of the context, which would clearly
                                                 ,                    

tell where the emphasis was to be laid.
                                      .




We have dwelt upon this punctuation in order to emphasize a purpose of
                                                                      

punctuation too often overlooked.
                                .







O and OH
        




The Century Dictionary says there is no difference between _O_ and _oh_
                                                                       

except that of their present spelling. The New Standard and Webster’s
                                     .                             ’ 

New International do not go so far, but they point out the difference
                                  ,                                  

observed by most good writers.
                             .




_O_ is generally used only in direct address; and, as the name of the
                                            ;    ,                   

person or thing addressed immediately follows it, it takes no mark of
                                                ,                    

punctuation after it. An exclamation-point may follow the group of
                    .               -                             

words introduced by _O_. Its vocative character is not lost when the
                       .                                            

person or thing addressed is not named, for it may be understood.
                                      ,                         .




_O_ is used more in poetry than in prose.
                                        .




_O_ is used in an ejaculatory expression when followed by _for_ or
                                                                  

_that_. It does not here seem to lose its vocative character, although
      .                                                     ,         

the name of the thing or person addressed may not readily be supplied.
                                                                     .




_O_ is sometimes used colloquially in expressions like “O my!” “O
                                                       “    !” “ 

dear!” etc.
    !”    .




_Oh_ is purely ejaculatory, and takes a comma or an exclamation-point
                          ,                                    -     

immediately after it; but the latter mark may follow the group of words
                    ;                                                  

beginning with _oh_, with a comma before _oh_.
                   ,                         .




_O_ is always written with a capital, but _oh_ takes a capital only
                                    ,                              

when beginning a sentence. Some writers prefer always to write _oh_
                         .                                         

with a capital.

CONVENTIONAL USES OF MARKS
                          







Many uses of marks seem to be based solely upon convention, or
                                                          ,   

arbitrary custom. Back of this convention there may be, in many cases,
                .                                     ,              ,

reason for the punctuation; but, more frequently, there seems to be no
                          ;    ,                ,                     

reason.
      .




It is not always worth while carefully to attempt to distinguish
                                                                

between reason and convention; but it is quite important to know what
                             ;                                       

is the best, or, at least, what is good, conventional usage, and to
           ,   ,         ,             ,                   ,       

follow it in one’s writing. We think it reasonable to call _good_ only
                ’         .                                           

such conventional punctuation as is found in the work of writers,
                                                                ,

and of expert editors of copy, who use marks with a fair degree of
                             ,                                    

consistency, and do not often violate the fundamental principles of
           ,                                                       

punctuation already discussed herein. The punctuation found in most

weekly and monthly periodicals is very poor, and is often inferior
                                           ,                      

to that of daily newspapers. In a very few magazines (it would be

in a considerable number of daily newspapers, the use of marks is
                                            ,

use of marks is so distractive as to make the presence of any mark

familiar with the meanings of most of the marks of punctuation.
                                                              .







THE PERIOD
          




1. A period or any other mark, except an interrogation-point, is not
 .                           ,                        -     ,       

often used after a display line in the title-page of a book. This
                                            -              .     

practice is well-nigh universal in book-work, and almost equally so in
                -                      -    ,                         

magazines.
         .




2. A period is generally placed after the letter or the number
 .                                                            

indicating a division in enumerations. Periods are so used after the
                                     .                              

figures 1 and 2 numbering this and the preceding paragraph.
                                                          .




If the divisions have subdivisions, and the subdivisions are further
                                  ,                                 

subdivided, it is helpful to the reader if a good conventional style
          ,                                                         

is followed. In case of four divisions and subdivisions, a good
           .                                           ,       

conventional style is as follows:
                                :




The capital letters (A, B, C, etc.) mark the main divisions of the
                    ( ,  ,  ,    .)                               

subject.
       .




The Roman capital numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.) mark the subdivision
                           ( ,   ,    ,   ,    .)                     

of A, B, C, etc.
    ,  ,  ,    .




The Arabic figures (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) mark the subdivision of I, II,
                   ( ,  ,  ,  ,    .)                          ,   ,

III, etc.
   ,    .




The small or lower-case letters (a, b, c, etc.) mark the subdivision of
                  -             ( ,  ,  ,    .)                        

1, 2, 3, etc. The italic letters are generally used.
 ,  ,  ,    .                                      .




If there is only a single enumeration, the Arabic figures (1, 2, 3,
                                     ,                    ( ,  ,  ,

etc.) are used.
   .)         .




If there are one enumeration and one subdivision, the Arabic figures
                                                ,                   

and the lower-case letters are used.
             -                     .




If one or more of the first divisions are subdivided, and one or more
                                                    ,                

of such subdivisions are subdivided, the Roman numerals, the Arabic
                                   ,                   ,           

figures, and the lower-case letters are used.
       ,              -                     .




The enumerating letters (A, B, etc.) of the first, or main, divisions
                        ( ,  ,    .)             ,        ,          

are indented the space of the usual paragraph; the subdivisions of the
                                             ;                        

first divisions are so far indented that their enumerating letters or
                                                                     

figures are in alignment with the first letter of the first word under
                                                                      

the division above. This mode of indention is continued with the next
                  .                                                  

subdivisions, thus putting the enumerating letters or figures of the
            ,                                                       

respective divisions or subdivisions in perpendicular alignment. This
                                                               .     

mode of enumeration and indention can be illustrated diagrammatically:
                                                                     :

This mode of indention and alignment is not observed unless the

A half-parenthesis is sometimes used with _a_, _b_, _c_, etc., as

Some punctuators enclose in parentheses figures and lower-case letters

Marks of parenthesis are properly used to enclose figures and letters
                                                                     

enumerating particulars within the limits of a sentence or a paragraph.
                                                                      .

If one or more of the particulars are composed of two or more
                                                             

sentences, each of the particulars should be put in paragraph form, in

                                                   .




  NOTE.—It is hardly proper to designate as a paragraph
      .—                                               

  that which is a part of a sentence; and we therefore use the term
                                    ;                              

  “paragraph form” to designate a group of words that is a part of a
  “              ”                                                  

  sentence, and is yet put in the form of a paragraph, and is numbered
          ,                                          ,                

  as a particular.
                 .




As a rule, each enumerating group in paragraph form is composed of one
         ,                                                            

or more sentences; and thus each enumerating figure or letter becomes
                 ;                                                   

a part of a paragraph group, and therefore loses its parenthetical
                           ,                                      

nature. If each paragraph group is composed of a single group of
      .                                                         

words constituting only a phrase or a sentence, it may be followed
                                              ,                   

conventionally by a semicolon, and thus give apparent justification for
                             ,

The following example will illustrate the point:

To divide paragraph groups by semicolons is so obviously inconsistent

The De Vinne Press does not use a period after the letters and figures

THE COLON
         




The conventional uses of the colon are not numerous. The following are

the principal ones:

1. Between figures expressing the time of day in hours and minutes;
 .                                                                ;

but, as stated above, the period is used by some good printing-houses:
   ,                ,                                         -      :

2. Between the name of a publisher and the place of publication,

especially in title-pages and in book titles:

  93. New York: The Macmillan Company.
    .         :                      .




3. After the salutatory phrase at the beginning of a letter, if not on

the first line of the letter:
                            :




  94. Dear Sir:

  Your letter of the 21st ultimo is at hand.

When the salutatory phrase is put on the first line of the text of the
                                                                      

letter, a comma and a dash is the usual punctuation:
      ,                                            :




  94-1. Dear Mr. Smith,—Your letter of the 25th ultimo is at hand.

4. After the salutatory phrase used by a speaker in addressing the

5. Many good punctuators use a dash with a colon when the colon is
 .                                                                

at the end of a paragraph. As the salutatory phrase in No. 94 is a
                         .                               .        

paragraph, a dash would follow the colon. This is the style of The

combination is not pleasing to the eye, and therefore we do not now use
                                      ,                                

the two marks together.
                      .




6. It cannot be denied that the use of the colon after different forms
 .

punctuation. We think it exceedingly bad punctuation; for it separates
           .                                        ;                 

words (the verb and its predicate) that are in the closest grammatical
      (                          )

       ,                           ;              ,    .




We think no mark is needed after “were.” As indicated elsewhere, if the
                                 “    .”                       ,       

particulars are put into paragraph form, thus leaving “were” at the end
                                       ,              “    ”           

of an incomplete line, a dash may be used, simply to act as a sort of
                     ,                   ,                           

leader for the eye, or as a partial filler of the blank space in the
                  ,                                                 

line:
    :




  95-1. Among those present were—John Brown, who made a speech....
    - .                         —          ,                  ....




Some good punctuators would use no mark after “were” in No. 95-1.
                                              “    ”      .   - .




In No. 95 we give Mr. Teall’s punctuation, which shows a comma before
     .              .      ’             ,                           

“etc.” This makes “etc.” stand for a modifier of “Jones”; and this,
“   .”            “   .”                         “     ”;         ,

in turn, puts three words, with their modifiers, in a series without
       ,                 ,                     ,                    

a conjunction before the last one. Such grouping is not in the usual
                                 .                                  

form of grouping, except in language where, as we believe, the proper
                ,                         ,              ,           

relations are overlooked, as they seem to be here.
                        ,                        .




This apparently doubtful meaning of the comma,— that is, whether it
                                             ,—        ,           

indicates that “etc.” stands for a modifier, like the preceding ones,
               “   .”                      ,                        ,

or for additional persons,—may be avoided by using “and” after the
                         ,—                        “   ”          

second semicolon, thus making “etc.” stand for a modifier of Jones, or
                ,             “   .”                              ,   

by the use of a semicolon after “Jones,” thus making “etc.” stand for
                                “     ,”             “   .”          

an additional group or groups.
                             .




In such sentences as No. 95, Mr. Wilson and other writers on
                       .   ,   .                            

punctuation suggest the use of a comma before the beginning of the
                                                                  

semicolon-divided group. This punctuation might be based upon the use
         -             .                                             

of a comma at the end of a long subject. The use of the colon is based,
                                       .                              ,

of course, on the ground that some introductory word like _namely_ is
         ,                                                           

understood.
          .







THE SEMICOLON
             




We believe there are only two purely conventional uses of the semicolon:
                                                                       :




1. As stated on a preceding page, a book title with a subtitle
 .                              ,                             

introduced by “or,” takes a semicolon before “or” and a comma after it:
              “  ,”                          “  ”                     :

  give Mr. Wilson’s rule for their use. He says:
         .       ’                    .        :




  97. A semicolon is put before _as_, _viz._, _to wit_, _namely_, _i.
    .                               ,     . ,         ,         ,   .

  e._, or _that is_, when they precede an example or a specification of
   . ,             ,                                                   

  particulars....
             ....




  NOTE.—The punctuation in the above sentence has a striking
      .—                                                    

  peculiarity, which may readily deceive even a very careful reader.
             ,                                                     .

  The use of “or” apparently makes _one_ of the particulars enumerated
             “  ”                                                     

  the antecedent of “they,” thus requiring the singular pronoun “it,”
                    “    ,”                                     “  ,”

  instead of “they,” in the clause that follows. As Mr. Wilson
             “    ,”                           .      .       

  would neither make nor overlook such a simple error in grammatical
                                                                    

  construction, we must look more closely for a meaning of the language
              ,                                                        

  that will justify the use of “they.” Such meaning is found in the
                               “    .”                             

  relation between “_i. e._” and “_that is_.” As “_i. e._” (_id est_)
                   “  .  . ”     “         .”    “  .  . ” (        )

  is the Latin abbreviation for “_that is_,” the _or_ relation exists
                                “         ,”                         

  between only these particulars in the list. The comma before “or”
                                            .                  “  ”

  follows the punctuation exemplified in Sentence 17. This meaning of
                                                    .                

  the language ends the series with “_i. e._”; and the relation between
                                    “  .  . ”;                         

  the items of the series is the _and_ relation, which requires the
                                               ,                   

  plural pronoun “they.”
                 “    .”




  The use of the conjunction “and” after “namely” would correct
                             “   ”       “      ”              

  the fault; but the meaning of the sentence might not be easily
           ;                                                    

  apprehended by all readers.
                            .




  These relations can best be revealed by recasting the language. It
                                                                .   

  may be done thus:
                  :




  97-1. A semicolon is put before _as_, _viz._, _to wit_, _namely_, and
    - .                               ,     . ,         ,         ,    

  _i. e._, or its English unabbreviated equivalent, _that is_, when
    .  . ,                                        ,          ,     

  they....
      ....




  If we attempt to remedy the fault by putting “_that is_” in
                                               “         ”   

  parentheses after “_i. e._,” we take “_that is_” out of the list of
                    “  .  . ,”         “         ”                   

  words enumerated, making it simply an explanation of “_i. e._”
                  ,                                    “  .  . ”




  A confusion in grouping, and consequently in meaning, due to the
                         ,                            ,           

  absence of the proper conjunction or the proper mark of punctuation
                                                                     

  at the end of a series, is very common.
                        ,               .




This use of the semicolon and a comma is without reason, so far as
                                                       ,          

we can determine; but it is very firmly fixed conventionally. The
                ;                                           .    

objection to it is, that it makes the semicolon a mark of apposition,
                  ,                                                 ,

along with the colon, the comma, and the comma and dash; and its use
                    ,          ,                       ;            

for such purpose detracts from its more common use of grouping when
                                                                   

the _and_ or _or_ relation exists, whether expressed or understood, as
                                 ,                                ,   

exemplified in Sentences 7 and 20-1.
                                 - .




Mr. De Vinne uses a comma before such an introductory particle, and a
  .                                                           ,      

colon after it; but he makes no reference to the established usage, nor
              ;                                                   ,    

does he give any reason for such punctuation. The reason is simple:
                                            .                     :

the particle is slightly parenthetical, thus requiring to be set off
                                      ,                             

by commas; but the relation between what precedes and what follows is
         ;                                                           

clearly the _colon_ relation. When particulars are formally enumerated,
                            .                                         ,

this relation requires a colon on one side of the particle; and the
                                                          ;        

colon will supersede one of the commas. On which side of the particle
                                      .                              

does the colon belong?
                     ?




Although Mr. De Vinne, in his own work, puts the colon _after_ the
           .         ,                ,                           

particle, the Century Dictionary, which is issued from the De Vinne
        ,                       ,                                  

Press, puts it _before_ the particle when introducing illustrative
     ,                                                            

examples. The position of the colon in either place is easily
        .                                                    

explained: if after the particle, the particle is more closely
         :                      ,                             

connected with the general term than with the particulars, which
                                                         ,      

follow the colon; if before the particle, the particle is more closely
                ;                       ,                             

connected with the particulars.
                              .




These relations will appear more clearly in examples:
                                                    :




  98. The student failed in three studies, namely: spelling, grammar,
    .                                    ,       :         ,        ,

  and history.

  98-1. The student failed in three studies: namely, spelling, grammar,
    - .                                    :       ,         ,        ,

  and history.
             .




If we substitute “by name” for “namely,” the sense relation between
                 “       ”     “      ,”                           

“namely” and “studies,” in one sentence, and between “namely” and
“      ”     “       ,”                ,             “      ”    

the items following in the other sentence, is unmistakable. We can
                                         ,                .       

therefore put any such particle where it seems best to reveal the
                                                                 

meaning.
       .




We think “by name” is closely associated with “studies,” just as the
         “       ”                            “       ,”            

word “named” or “called” would be, if used in the place of “by name.”
     “     ”    “      ”         ,                         “       .”

This relation therefore requires the colon after the particle.
                                                             .







THE INTERROGATION-POINT
                 -     




The mark of interrogation has three uses:
                                        :




1. It is used after a word or group of words asking a question, whether
 .                                                            ,        

or not such word or words indicate by their form that a question is
                                                                   

asked. This usage has already been illustrated. (Page 2.)

2. Enclosed in the proper marks (parentheses, if in the writer’s own

language; brackets, if in quoted language), it is placed at a point in
        ;         ,                      ),                           

a sentence to indicate that the writer questions the accuracy of what
                                                                     

immediately precedes it.
                       .




This use of the mark of interrogation is not in good taste unless it is
                                                                       

for a serious, and not a frivolous, purpose. A foot-note is, in most
             ,                    ,        .       -       ,        

cases, a better means of expression:
     ,                             :




  99. He said he was born in 1840(?).

                  [?].”




3. It is used by an editor in the margin of a manuscript, or by a
 .                                                      ,        

proof-reader in the margin of a proof, to question the accuracy of
     -                               ,                            

a statement or the correctness of the form of language at the point
                                                                   

indicated by the editor or proof-reader. When thus used it is not
                                -      .                         

necessarily enclosed in other marks.
                                   .







THE EXCLAMATION-POINT
               -     




This point is used in two ways:
                              :




1. It is used after a word or group of words to express command,
 .                                                             ,

surprise, or emotion.
        ,           .




2. Enclosed in brackets, it is used in a quotation to express surprise,
 .                     ,                                              ,

irony, or contempt.
     ,            .




  101. Wake up! Something is going wrong!
     .        !                         !




  102. Oh, how hard my lot[!]
     .   ,                [!]




The practice of using two or three exclamation-points together is not
                                              -                      

now followed.
            .







ELLIPSIS
        




When one, for the sake of brevity or otherwise, omits a word, a group
        ,                                     ,             ,        

of words, or one or more sentences from a quotation, such omission,
        ,                                          ,              ,

or _ellipsis_, is indicated by either periods or stars. Periods are
             ,                                        .            

generally preferred on the ground that they look better on the printed
                                                                      

page than stars. Unfortunately, the number of periods used for an
               .              ,                                  

ellipsis is not definitely fixed by convention. Some writers and
                                              .                 

printers use three, and others use four; we prefer three.
                  ,                    ;                .




If words are omitted from the end of a sentence, the end-mark of
                                               ,        -       

the sentence, if an exclamation-point or an interrogation-point,
            ,                  -                         -     ,

is retained, and follows the three periods. If the end-mark of the
           ,                              .           -           

sentence is a period, and one or more sentences following are omitted,
                    ,                                                ,

there will be four periods at this point. There will be the same number
                                        .                              

if words are omitted from the beginning of a sentence following a
                                                                 

sentence ending with a period.
                             .




If stars are used, the closing period is retained.
                 ,                               .




If one or more paragraphs, or if, in poetry, one or more lines, are
                         ,      ,          ,                  ,    

omitted, a full line of periods or stars is used.
       ,                                        .




A dash or stars are used in the place of letters omitted from a word,
                                                                    ,

and the dash in place of figures omitted from a number of figures.
                                                                 .

Stars were formerly much used for omitted letters.
                                                 .




Examples will illustrate the punctuation under consideration. Our
                                                            .    

first example is taken from the current issue of a well-known weekly
                                                       -            

periodical:
          :




  103. Who commissioned them, a minority, a less than minority ...?...
     .                      ,           ,                      ...?...

  Some of them are misguided, some of them are blind, most of them are
                            ,                       ,                 

  ignorant. I would rather pray for them.... They do not tell me what
          .                             ....                         

  they are attempting.
                     .




How shall we interpret the marks indicating the three ellipses in the
                                                                     

above sentence?
              ?




The first three periods stand for words omitted from the end of an
                                                                  

interrogative sentence, whose end-mark follows such periods.
                      ,          -                         .




The second group of three periods indicates an ellipsis of one or more
                                                                      

entire sentences. If they indicated an ellipsis of only a part of the
                .                                                    

next sentence, “Some” would not begin with a capital.
             , “    ”                               .




The next group of four periods is composed of three periods for the
                                                                   

ellipsis and one period for the end-mark of the sentence.
                                   -                    .




It should be noted that ellipses from quotations are of only such
                                                                 

matter as can be omitted without affecting the sense of the language
                                                                    

quoted.
      .




Marks of quotation will include the marks of ellipsis that begin or end
                                                                       

the quoted matter.
                 .




The use of stars in the first part of No. 103 will convey no more
                                        .                        

definite information than the periods give the reader; but their use in

the second part of the sentence, accompanied by a period, will at once

show that they stand for the ellipsis of one or more sentences:
                                                              :

CHAPTER XI
          




QUOTATION-MARKS
         -     







Quotation-marks are either single or double. The former consist of one
         -                                 .                          

inverted comma and one apostrophe; the latter, of two inverted commas
                                 ;           ,                       

and two apostrophes.
                   .




The double marks are very generally used in this country for a single
                                                                     

quotation; but some writers and some printing-offices follow the
         ;                                   -                  

English style of using the single marks.
                                       .




Quotation-marks are used by a writer to identify as the exact language
         -                                                            

of another writer a word or group of words which the first writer uses
                                                                      

within his own language.
                       .




They are sometimes used by a writer to enclose a quotation from his own
                                                                       

printed or spoken language. The fact that such quoted matter is his own
                          .                                            

language is practically always shown by the text.
                                                .




If the quoted language contains a quotation, such quotation is
                                           ,                  

identified by the quotation-marks (single or double) not used for the
                           -      (                )                 

main quotation.
              .




If the subordinate quotation begins the main quotation, three marks
                                                      ,            

(one double and one single) are used at the beginning; if the
(                         )                          ;       

subordinate ends the main, three marks are also used at the close.
                         ,                                       .




Illustrations of the three uses above defined are found in the
                                                              

following examples:
                  :




  104. In appreciation of Mrs. George Ripley, Mr. Frothingham says,
     .                       .              ,   .                 ,

  “Theodore Parker made the following entry in his journal: ‘Mrs.
  “                                                       : ‘   .

  Ripley gave me a tacit rebuke for not shrieking at wrongs, and spoke
                                                           ,          

  of the danger of losing our humanity in abstractions.’”
                                                      .’”




If a quotation consists of two or more paragraphs appearing
                                                           

_consecutively_ in the work quoted from, quotation-marks are used only
                                       ,          -                   

at the beginning of each paragraph and at the end of the last one. If
                                                                 .   

two or more paragraphs are printed consecutively in the quotation, but
                                                                 ,    

do not appear consecutively in the work quoted from, each paragraph is
                                                   ,                  

identified as a whole by marks at its beginning and end.
                                                       .




If only a part of a sentence or of a paragraph is quoted, and it is
                                                        ,          

desirable to show this fact, the omitted part or parts are indicated by
                           ,                                           

periods or stars. If such marks of omission come at the beginning or at
                .                                                      

the end of the quoted matter, the marks of quotation are so placed as
                            ,                                        

to include them.
               .




If the quoted matter is a letter or document with place-and date-lines
                                                       -        -     

preceding it, and with a complimentary closing-line and one or more
            ,                                 -                    

signatures following it, each of such lines and names is treated as a
                       ,                                             

paragraph, and takes its proper marks before or after it, or both.
         ,                                              ,        .




It is much better practice in printing to put such matter in smaller

It was formerly the practice to put quotation marks at the beginning

                                         ;                            

is now followed, especially in legal documents.

The practice in many newspaper offices furnishes, we think, a

satisfactory solution of the problem. When quoted matter is given
                                    .                            

close grammatical relation to the text, the marks of quotation are
                                      ,                           

used before the first word of the quotation and before each line, with
                                                                ,     

the proper closing marks at the end of the quotation. Such a quotation

should not exceed ten or twelve lines in length. Larger quotations
                                               .

OTHER USES OF QUOTATION-MARKS
                       -     




A word or group of words is sometimes enclosed in quotation-marks to
                                                           -        

give to such word or group of words a meaning somewhat different from
                                                                     

its usual meaning. This use of the marks has a very wide range; and
                 .                                            ;

appear in illustrative examples:
                               :




  105. A drop-folio is generally used on a page on which a chapter
     .       -                                                    

  begins or on a page containing an illustration extending to its top.
                                                                     .




  105-1. A “drop-folio” is a page-number that is put at the bottom of
     - .   “    -     ”          -                                   

  the page.
          .




In No. 105-1 “drop-folio” is singled out as an uncommon word, as if
     .    -  “    -     ”                                   ,      

quoted; and this fact is shown by the marks. In No. 105 it is used as
      ;                                    .      .                  

is any other word in the sentence.

  106. He received “big wages,” $1.00 a day.
     .             “         ,” $ .        .




In No. 106 we put “big wages” in quotation-marks to imply that some one
     .            “         ”             -                            

has used this familiar expression in a boastful way without telling the
                                                                       

whole truth, which is exposed in the small sum that follows.

  107. She was very fond of “five-o’clocks.”
     .                      “    - ’      .”




In No. 107 the writer implies that the afternoon teas of society are
     .                                                              

frivolous things. This is perhaps a purely conventional use of the
                .                                                 

marks, without an underlying reason for the meaning thus given.
     ,                                                        .




In the next sentence the writer groups, by means of the marks, certain
                                      ,                      ,        

words into a title, which are identified by quotation-marks. Italics
                  ,                                  -     .        

would answer the same purpose; but the former marks are preferred:
                             ;                                   :




  108. This fundamental work might be called, “An Introduction to the
     .                                      , “                      

  Study of Literature”; or, “The Elements of Literature.”
                     ”;   , “                          .”




The above sentence is quoted from an educational magazine of high

use of the semicolon and comma in the sentence is the conventional
                                                                  

style of punctuating compound book-titles, as illustrated in Sentence

96. But the quotation-marks show that this is not a compound title, but
  .                  -                                            ,    

alternative titles. The real meaning would be more clearly expressed by
                  .                                                    

the use of “either” after “called”; and this shows that the punctuation
           “      ”       “      ”;                                    

is wrong. Either the semicolon and the comma or the quotation-marks
        .                                                    -     

must be omitted. The meaning to be conveyed will determine which marks
               .                                                      

to omit.
       .




If the semicolon and comma are not the proper marks here, how shall
                                                        ,          

we determine what mark, if any, should precede “or”? Simply by the
                      ,       ,                “  ”?              

degree of liability to error in making a wrong combination of words at
                                                                      

this point. The quotation-marks before “or” close the first quotation,
          .              -             “  ”                          ,

making a complete group of words; and the quotation-marks following
                                ;                  -               

“or” open a new group of words. As there is here no liability on the
“  ”                          .                                     

part of the reader to make a wrong grouping out of some words that
                                                                  

precede and some that follow “or,” a mark before “or” can serve no
                             “  ,”               “  ”             

purpose. Each group is bound up in its own marks of quotation, and is a
       .                                                     ,         

name; and the two names are alternatives. With this interpretation of
    ;                                   .                            

the meaning of the language as determined by the quotation-marks alone,
                                                          -           ,

the sentence would be punctuated as follows:
                                           :




  108-1. This fundamental work might be called, “An Introduction to the

                     ”    “                          .”




The use of the comma after “called” in the above sentence is purely
                           “      ”                                

conventional. It is somewhat like the use of the comma before “that”
            .                                                 “    ”

following “is,” as treated elsewhere. Or, we may say, it is a purely
          “  ,”                     .   ,           ,               

rhetorical use, as the reading of the somewhat long title seems to

require a pause after “called,” in order to identify the group to
                      “      ,”                                  

follow. The omission of the comma could not be called poor punctuation.
      .                                                               .







Quotation-marks are used in the report of a conversation or dialogue
         -                                                          

in which the names of the speakers are not printed at the beginning

However, some writers do not use quotation-marks for this purpose, and
       ,                                  -                      ,

purpose of inserting words not a part of the quotation, each of the

two parts into which the quoted matter is thus broken, is enclosed in

De Vinne says “italic is preferred by bookish men.” Most writers make

When the closing marks of quotation follow a word or group of words

  The above legends (inscriptions) appear under two pictures in a

  well-edited current magazine. Why does the title in No. 4 take marks
      -                       .                         .             

  of quotation, while that in No. 3 does not?
              ,                 .           ?




  Two reasons may be given for the use of the marks in No. 4, while one

  reason is sufficient for their absence in No. 3. “Our Boatman” is the

  requires the quotation-marks. Secondly, the words “Our Boatman” are
                        -     .         ,           “           ”

  our boatman,—that is, the picture is not a photograph of John Smith,
             ,—       ,                                              ,

  In No. 3 the language is taken in its literal meaning, and even may

  Probably no painter would put upon his canvas “A Portrait of John

CHAPTER XII
           




BRACKETS AND PARENTHESES
                        







The principal use of brackets is to show that a bracketed word or group
                                                                       

of words in a quotation is inserted by the writer using the quoted
                                                                  

language, and not by the author of such language. Parentheses, on the
        ,                                       .            ,       

other hand, are used by a writer, as we have already seen, to enclose a
          ,                     ,                        ,             

parenthetical word or group of words in his own language.
                                                        .




Some examples that furnish apparent exceptions to these general
                                                               

statements considered as rules, may serve to emphasize the principle of
                              ,                                        

this punctuation.
                .




The following examples (Nos. 112-115) are taken from the “Style Book”
                       (   .    -   )                    “          ”

of the Government Printing-Office.
                          -      .




  NOTE.—We follow in the examples the capitalization and
      .—                                                

  punctuation of the original. For this reason we do not use a hyphen
                             .                                       

  in writing the quoted title (Style Book), above.
                              (          ),      .




These examples are given in this style-book for the guidance of
                                      -                        

type-setters in their work in the Government Printing-Office. They
    -                                                -      .     

appear to be extracts from the _Congressional Record_:
                                                     :




  112. Mr. SPEAKER. Is there any objection to the consideration of this
     .   .        .                                                    

  bill at this time? [After a pause.] There is no objection.
                   ? [             .]                      .




  113. Mr. SPEAKER (after a pause). If no gentleman claims the floor,
     .   .         (             ).                                 ,

                                                     .




  114. Mr. HEALD. The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. SHERLEY]
     .   .      .                             [  .        ]

  stated that he would support the measure.
                                          .




  115. Mr. HEALD. The gentleman from Kentucky, Col. SHERLEY,
     .   .      .                            ,    .        ,

  stated that he would support the measure.
                                          .




In these examples the names of the persons speaking are so manifestly
                                                                     

inserted by the reporter that they need no identification marks.
                                                               .




In No. 112 three words are inserted within the text by the reporter,
     .                                                             ,

and take brackets for identification as matter inserted in the language
                                                                       

of another.
          .




In No. 113 the same three words, manifestly inserted by the reporter,
     .                         ,                                    ,

take parentheses. They do so because they clearly belong to what
                .                                               

precedes, which is not a part of the text, but is the reporter’s
        ,                                ,                    ’ 

language. The use of brackets here would be bad punctuation.
        .                                                  .

The parentheses are used because the words enclosed are purely
                                                              

_parenthetical_ in their relation to the preceding word, which is the
                                                       ,             

reporter’s language.
        ’          .




In No. 114 the words “Mr. SHERLEY” are inserted by the
     .               “  .        ”                    

reporter, and therefore take brackets. In No. 115 the words “Col.
        ,                            .      .               “   .

SHERLEY” are the language of Mr. Heald, and therefore take the
       ”                       .      ,                       

usual punctuation (commas).
                  (      ).




Another apparent exception to the above rule is found in the various
                                                                    

modes of printing stage directions in dramatic composition. As such
                                                          .        

directions have no reference to the meaning of the language of the
                                                                  

text, it is desirable, in printing them, to show this fact by their
    ,                ,                 ,                           

form. In the main, such directions are either centered lines shorter
    .            ,                                                  

than the text, or are indented more than the usual space of the
             ,                                                 

paragraph. They may be enclosed in brackets or parentheses, and be
         .                                                ,       

printed in either italic or Roman type, or in italics without the
                                      ,                          

brackets or parentheses.
                       .




If a direction precedes, as it does sometimes, the speech to which it
                       ,                     ,                       

belongs, and is in the opening line of such speech, it necessarily
       ,                                          ,               

is enclosed in brackets. If it follows and ends the last line of the
                       .                                            

speech, it takes a single bracket at the beginning of the direction. If
      ,                                                            .   

it follows, and is put below, the last line, it takes a single bracket,
          ,                 ,              ,                          ,

or is printed in the style of the direction preceding the speech.
                                                                .




Thus we see that the variety of style in printing stage directions
                                                                  

grows out of the fact that they are sometimes identified as stage

We shall not take space to illustrate the above varieties of
                                                            

punctuation. Examples can readily be found in almost any library.

We have dwelt perhaps more at length upon this varied punctuation than

it a principle underlying even conventional punctuation.

Our next sentence illustrates a very common use of brackets. In this
                                                           .        

sentence we make the first enclosure (_sic_), the second being that of
                                     (     ),                         

the writer who made the quotation:
                                 :




  116. In one of John Smith’s quaint letters to the Royal Council of
     .                     ’                                        

  Virginia, sitting in London, he says: “And I humbly entreat you
          ,                  ,        : “                        

  hereafter, [_sic_] let us know what we [are to] receive, and not
           , [     ]                     [      ]        ,

                      ’                                      .”




When inserted in a quotation, the Latin word “_sic_,” meaning _thus_,
                            ,                “     ,”               ,

signifies that what immediately precedes it is found in the original.
                                                                    .

By thus calling attention to it, the writer who makes the quotation
                               ,                                   

implies that an error exists at this point. Our own insertion of
                                          .                     

“_sic_” is meant to say that the comma preceding it is in the original,
“     ”                                                               ,

and to question its correctness. The position of the comma makes
                               .                                

“hereafter” qualify what precedes, as if it read, “I hereafter entreat
“         ”                      ,              , “                   

you.” The evident meaning is, “hereafter let us know.”
   .”                       , “                     .”




The words “are to,” enclosed in the next brackets, were inserted by the
          “      ,”                              ,                     

writer who quoted from John Smith’s letter.

“Sic” is put in italics because this is the conventional way of
“   ”                                                          

writing most words from a foreign language. The words “are to,” being
                                          .           “      ,”

Sometimes a line of poetry is too long for the type-measure in which

the poem is set. If one or more words of such line are carried forward
               .                                                      

to make a new and very short line, the space between the full line
                                 ,                                

above and the full line below such short line may be as wide as the
                                                                   

space between two verses, and thus present a bad effect to the eye. To

avoid this the extra word or words may be put in the line above, if the

It is a common practice in legal and commercial work to enclose in
                                                                  

parentheses Arabic figures corresponding to the preceding number
                                                                

expressed in words. This practice often gives rise to a mistake that,
                  .                                                 ,

     .                                  -     ($  .  )        .




The matter in the parentheses should be simply “25,” to correspond with
                                               “  ,”                   

what precedes; or the sentence should be written thus:

  117-1. Pay to John Smith or order twenty-five dollars ($25.00).

        ,                                                           ,

PUNCTUATION WITHIN PARENTHESES OR BRACKETS
                                          




Matter within parentheses or brackets refers to what precedes these
                                                                   

marks, which may be a mark of punctuation, a single word, a group of
     ,                                   ,              ,           

words forming part of a sentence, an entire sentence, or two or more
                                ,                   ,               

sentences.
         .




We cannot show by the punctuation how much of the preceding matter is
                                                                     

referred to; but a conventional treatment of the punctuation for this
           ;                                                         

purpose is helpful, even though such treatment is not uniform.
                  ,                                          .




The enclosed matter either falls between the parts of a sentence or
                                                                   

follows a sentence. When within a sentence the enclosed matter does
                  .                                                

not begin with a capital letter, even though a full sentence, unless
                               ,                            ,       

the first word is a proper noun; nor does it take a period at its end.
                               ;                                     .

If, however, the language is either interrogative or exclamatory, it
  ,        ,                                                    ,   

takes the proper mark to show this; and such mark is placed within the
                                  ;                                   

parentheses or brackets.
                       .




When the enclosed matter follows a sentence, it may refer to a word
                                           ,                       

or to a small group of words within such sentence, to all of the
                                                 ,              

sentence, or to two or more preceding sentences. It is at this point
        ,                                      .                    

that a conventional treatment of the subject may be helpful, the
                                                           ,    

object of such treatment being to show, at a glance, how far the
                                      ,            ,            

reference extends. If the enclosed matter refers to the last word of
                 .                                                  

the sentence, or to a short group of words near the end, it receives
            ,                                          ,            

the same treatment given it when wholly within the sentence. If
                                                           .   

such enclosed matter refers to a larger part of the sentence than
                                                                 

above described, to the entire sentence, or to two or more preceding
               ,                       ,                            

sentences, it is regarded as an independent sentence. As such it is
         ,                                          .              

separated from the preceding sentence by the space usually put between
                                                                      

sentences; it begins with a capital letter; and the proper end-mark is
         ;                                ;                   -       

put within the parentheses, with no mark following outside.
                          ,                               .




We believe there is only one mark used within parentheses with
                                                              

reference to a mark outside. The English practice, which is followed by
                           .                     ,                     

a number of high-class periodicals in this country, is as follows: if
                -                                 ,              :   

a comma is required where a parenthesis is to be inserted, a comma is
                                                         ,           

placed before the first enclosing mark, and is repeated at the end of
                                      ,                              

the language within the parentheses.
                                   .




We prefer to use only one mark when required by the text without
                                                                

reference to the parenthesis, and to put it after the parentheses, thus
                            ,                                    ,     

more clearly confining the parenthesis to what precedes.
                                                       .




Our illustrative examples will show these points more clearly.

  While we have not used quotation-marks with our illustrative
                                  -                           

  sentences and examples, practically all of which are quoted, we do so
                        ,                                    ,         

  with the above examples, in order to exhibit their use.
                         ,                              .




  The punctuation of this example illustrates the following points:
                                                                  :




  1. The use of marks of quotation at the beginning of every paragraph,
   .                                                                  ,

  or group of words put in paragraph form, with like closing marks
                                         ,                        

  after the last line, informs the reader that the paragraphs quoted
                     ,                                              

  appear consecutively in the original.
                                      .




  2. The titles of the books named, with one exception, are not
   .                              ,                   ,        

  enclosed in marks of quotation in the original. If they were so
                                                .                

  enclosed, each title in our example would be enclosed in single marks
          ,                                                            

  of quotation, in addition to the double marks at the beginning.
              ,                                                 .




  3. The name of each novel (Tom Jones, etc.) is treated as a complete
   .                        (         ,    .)                         

  sentence, and so takes a period after it. The matter following each
          ,                               .                          

  sentence (name of a novel) refers to the entire sentence, thus
           (               )                              ,     

  requiring a period within the marks of parenthesis enclosing the name
                                                                       

  of the author.
               .




  4. The treatment of the last-named title (Kenilworth) is somewhat
   .                          -            (          )            

  unusual. It is put in paragraph form, probably to conform to the
         .                            ,                           

  paragraph form above; but it lacks the usual introduction of
                      ;                                       

  particulars that calls for the paragraph form.
                                               .




  The commas before and within the parentheses follow the English
                                                                 

  style. As a comma is required between “Kenilworth” and the
       .                                “          ”        

  explanatory group of words following the parenthesis, we should use
                                                      ,              

  only one, putting it after the marks of parenthesis.
          ,                                          .




  Those who adopt the English style apparently always use the commas
                                                                    

  when the matter within parentheses or brackets falls within the
                                                                 

  sentence, even though the relation between what follows and what
          ,                                                       

  precedes the parentheses or brackets does not require a comma. We
                                                               .   

  consider such punctuation bad, for it appears to treat the matter
                               ,                                   

  so enclosed as both _slightly_ and _wholly_ parenthetical. Our next
                                                           .         

  example (No. 6), a quotation, illustrates this point.
          (  .  ),            ,                       .




  5. We do not know why “Tristam Shandy” takes marks of quotation
   .                    “              ”                         

  (single marks in the example), while the names of the other books
  (                           ),                                   

  take none.
           .




6. I permitted myself, [he said,] the prophecy that their prejudices
 .                   , [       ,]                                   

were destined to vanish.
                       .




  While we use a comma, as in the paragraph (No. 5) preceding Example
                      ,                     (  .  )                  

  6, after parentheses or brackets when required by the language
   ,                                                            

  outside of the parentheses or brackets, and use no comma unless
                                        ,                        

  so required, we think the English practice poor punctuation. This
             ,                                               .     

  conventional use of two commas ignores the sense relation between the
                                                                       

  groups of words preceding and following the parentheses or brackets,
                                                                     ,

  which sense relation may be determined by the presence or the absence
                                                                       

  of a comma.

CHAPTER XIII
            




ABBREVIATIONS AND MISCELLANY
                            







We shall not attempt to treat the subject of abbreviations exhaustively
                                                                       

or even fully, for it goes beyond the subject of punctuation; but its
             ,                                              ;        

importance seems to justify its consideration at some length.
                                                            .




In the best printing-offices, if their expert copy-readers prepare
                    -       ,                     -

                                           ,                       ,

correspondence.
              .







FORM OF ADDRESS
               




The abbreviations in forms of address accepted by the printing-offices
                                                              -       

issuing three works on punctuation and style, especially mentioned in
                                            ,                        

our preface, are the following:
           ,                  :




By the De Vinne Press, _Mr._, _Mrs._, _Messrs._, _Jr._, and _Sr._
                     ,    . ,     . ,        . ,    . ,        . 




By the University of Chicago Press, _Mr._, _Messrs._, _Mrs._ (French,
                                  ,    . ,        . ,     .  (      ,

_M._, _MM._, _Mme_, _Mlle_), _Dr._, _Rev._, _Hon._, _St._ [Saint], and
  . ,    . ,      ,       ),    . ,     . ,     . ,    .  [     ],

These lists are somewhat misleading. Although not uniform, it is
                                   .                     ,      

probable that the practice of the three offices from which they come,
                                                                    ,

is uniform, with one exception. In the list from the “Manual for
          ,                   .                      “

written with periods, as, we think, they should be.
                    ,   ,         ,               .




It is a matter of course that the plural form _MM._, given in only one
                                                 . ,                  

list, and the plural forms _Mmes._ and _Mlles._, not given at all, are
    ,                           .            . ,                 ,    

treated the same as the abbreviations of the singular forms of the same.
                                                                       .




  NOTE.—We are unable to interpret the parenthesis in
      .—                                             

  the above list from the University of Chicago Press. The terms
                                                     .          

  within the parentheses are only remotely, if at all, explanatory
                                          ,          ,            

  of the preceding terms; and, although they belong in the list of
                        ;    ,                                    

  abbreviations, they are taken out of the list by being put in
               ,                                               

  parentheses. Moreover, “Mlle,” which is within the parentheses, has
             .         , “    ,”                                ,    

  no reference to any term outside of the marks.
                                               .




While the above and other points in abbreviations discussed herein,
                                                                  ,

are closely to be observed in the text of a book and in formal

foot-notes, indexes, etc., are used freely.

FIRM OR CORPORATION NAMES
                         




In business correspondence courtesy requires that abbreviations adopted
                                                                       

in a firm or a corporation name be carefully observed by others,
                                                               ,

regardless of the in elegance of such forms.
                                           .




_Bro._, _Bros._, and _Co._ are used in firm names following _&_, but
    . ,      . ,        .                                    & ,    

not otherwise. They should always be spelled out when preceded by a
             .                                                     

proper adjective.
                .




_John Smith & Bro._; _Brown, Smith & Co._, and like forms are used.
            &    . ;       ,       &   . ,                        .




In _Smith Brothers_, _Smith Company_, and like forms the final word is
                   ,                ,                                 

not abbreviated.
               .




While the “short and” (&) is commonly used in firm names, “and” is
          “         ” (&)                               , “   ”   

frequently seen:
               :




_Armour and Company_.
                    .




It is very rare that a comma is used before the final “and” or “&” in
                                                      “   ”    “&”   

firm names of three or more words constituting a series. If a firm
                                                       .          

prefers so to punctuate its name, others who write the name should not
                                ,                                     

insert a comma.
              .







FIGURES
       




As there are few fixed conventional uses for figures, we shall give
                                                    ,              

simply our preferences.
                      .




In ordinary reading matter, spell out all round numbers, and numbers
                          ,                            ,            

of one or two digits, unless of a technical character. When several
                    ,                                .             

numbers occur close together, and are to be compared, they may be
                            ,                       ,            

expressed in figures:
                    :




  120. Admission, one dollar.
     .          ,           .




  120-1. Admission, fifty cents.
     - .          ,            .




  120-2. Admission: Men, $2; women, $1.50; children, 50 cents.
     - .          :    , $ ;      , $ .  ;         ,         .




In No. 120-2 we use “50,” instead of “fifty,” because figures are used
     .    -         “  ,”            “     ,”                         

to express other numbers in the sentence.
                                        .







TIME OF DAY
           




The time of day is generally spelled out in ordinary reading matter:
                                                                   :




  121. We shall start at four o’clock this afternoon.
     .                         ’                    .




But with A. M. and P. M. (these abbreviations are
          .  .      .  . (                       

best set in small capitals) figures are always used:
                          )                        :




121-1. We shall start at 4 P. M.
   - .                      .  .







TEMPERATURE, ETC.
           ,    .




Figures are used to express temperature, specific gravity, and like
                                       ,                 ,         

technical matter.
                .




  122. The specific gravity of gold is 19.27. Its melting-point is
     .                                   .  .            -        

  1947° F. (1064° C.)

The letters “th,” “st,” and “d” (“d” is preferable to “nd” or “rd”)
            “  ,” “  ,”     “ ” (“ ”                  “  ”    “  ”)

should not be used with the number expressing the day of the month,
                                                                  ,

except when preceding the name of the month:
                                           :




  123. We left on July 9, 1915.
     .                  ,     .




  123-1. We left on July 9.
     - .                  .




  123-2. We left on the 9th of July.
     - .                           .




Many good writers would use “th” in No. 123-1, probably because it
                            “  ”      .    - ,                    

expresses the usual oral form of the date.
                                         .




In printing consecutive numbers, like dates, numbers of pages, etc.,
                               ,           ,                 ,    .,

certain omissions may be indicated by the dash; but the exact meaning
                                              ;                      

of this and another mode of writing these numbers should be understood.
                                                                      .

Examples will illustrate this:
                             :




  124. He was in England in 1914-15.
     .                          -  .




  124-1. He spent the winter of 1914-15 in England.

No. 124, strictly interpreted, means _all_ of the two years indicated;
  .    ,                     ,                                       ;

but it may be an indefinite portion of the last of 1914 and a like
                                                                  

portion of the first of 1915. In No. 124-1 the latter meaning is
                            .      .    -                       

specifically given by the word _winter_.
                                       .




No. 125 means that the subject is treated continuously on the pages
  .                                                                

mentioned; but it may not occupy _all_ of pages 25 and 27.
         ;                                               .




No. 125-1 means that the subject is referred to on each of the pages
  .    -                                                            

numbered, but not to the exclusion of other matter.
        ,                                         .




In No. 125-2, in order to save space, the comma takes the place of
     .    - ,                       ,                             

“and” between two numbers, just as the dash takes the place of “to”
“   ”                    ,                                     “  ”

between “25” and “27” in No. 125. Such omission of “and” is found in
        “  ”     “  ”      .    .                  “   ”            

the text only when the figures are enclosed in parentheses; but it is
                                                          ;          

common without the parentheses in foot-notes, tables, and indexes.
                                      -     ,       ,            .




In No. 125-3 we use “to” instead of a dash. “To” is generally used when
     .    -         “  ”                  . “  ”                       

a considerable number of pages is named. No definite rule can be given
                                       .                              

for such usage.
              .




An apparent exception to the interpretation of the numbers in No. 125
                                                                .    

is not infrequently found in the manner of writing the street numbers
                                                                     

of a building, especially as found on letter-heads:
             ,                              -     :




  126. John Smith & Co.

  25-27 Water Street

As buildings on one side of a street take the odd numbers, and on the
                                                         ,           

other side the even numbers, we know that John Smith & Co. are located
                           ,                         &   .

_street_ and _avenue_ is to write “avenue” first with its number
                                  “      ”                      

expressed in words, followed by the street with its number in figures:
                  ,                                                  :

If a house number precedes the spelled-out name of the street, the

former takes figures, in order readily to distinguish it from the name
                    ,

  127-1. He resides at 34 Tenth Avenue South.

If it is desirable to begin a sentence with a number, such number
                                                    ,            

should be spelled out, and not expressed in figures:
                     ,                             :




  128. Two thousand people met in the park.

BIBLE REFERENCES
                




As the forms of Bible references are very numerous we shall give only
                                                                     

two, which, we think, represent the best modern usage:
   ,      ,         ,                                :




  129. Matt, iv, 4; 1 Cor. i, 29.

  130. Gen. 2:3-6, 9; 3:17.
     .    .  : - ,  ;  :  .




As the Roman numerals were formerly, and still are to some extent,
                                   ,                             ,

followed by a period, this usage would give the following in the place
                    ,

We think No. 129 the better style.
           .                     .







FOOT-NOTES
    -     




The style in foot-notes is so varied that we shall consider only one or
                 -                                                     

two points involved.
                   .




Superior figures in the text have taken the place almost altogether
                                                                   

of the star, dagger, etc., both because they are less conspicuous and
           ,       ,    .,                                           

because they can be extended in number.
                                      .




The lower-case superior italic letters are sometimes used instead of,
         -                                                          ,

or together with, superior figures, as in the Bible.
                ,                 ,                .




In ordinary work, the superior figures or letters follow the word or
                ,                                                   

group of words concerning which the reference is made. In the Bible the
                                                     .                 

figures and letters precede such word or words.
                                              .




The figures before the notes corresponding to the figures in the text
                                                                     

are generally superior figures; but the ordinary figures are sometimes
                              ;                                       

used, because, as each number begins a paragraph, the superior figures
    ,        ,                                  ,                     

are too small to look well.
                          .




The punctuation of foot-notes, and other details of their composition,
                       -     ,                                       ,

are treated differently by different writers. A single illustration

will serve to show a well-recognized style of composing such notes:

No. 130 specifies foot-note No. 5, and refers to an article in a

Foot-notes are often extensively used in scientific periodicals and
    -                                                              

books; and the larger establishments that print such matter usually
     ;                                                             

have their style-cards, which should be followed by authors submitting

manuscripts to such establishments.
                                  .




The lower-case italic letters, “_a_,” “_b_,” and “_c_,” and sometimes
         -                   , “   ,” “   ,”     “   ,”              

the superior letters, are used to indicate the first, second, and third
                    ,                               ,       ,          

parts of a verse, paragraph, or page referred to by an accompanying

MISCELLANEOUS
             




The word _cent_ in _per cent_ is now generally written without a period.
                                                                       .







_Etc._ is preferable to _&c._ when used for “and others” or “and so
    .                    & .                “          ”    “

Each number stands for a suppressed part of the word in which it

THE APOSTROPHE
              




There are but few uses of the apostrophe, and they are well settled, as
                                        ,                          ,

certain unusual or peculiar names: _i’s_ and _t’s_, _6’s_ and _7’s_,
                                 :   ’         ’  ,   ’         ’  ,

CHAPTER XIV
           




COMPOUND WORDS
              







We add this chapter on compound words to a work on punctuation simply
                                                                     

to record our high estimate of the value of the subject, and our
                                                       ,        

protest against its complete neglect by high schools and colleges, as
                                                                 ,   

well as by very many good writers.
                                 .




As in spelling, a few rules may be helpful; but, also as in spelling,
              ,                           ;    ,                    ,

words, will enable a writer to attain any degree of perfection in their

use.
   .




We believe there is only one fairly complete work on the subject, and
                                                                ,    

that is by Mr. F. Horace Teall, who was a department editor of the
             .  .             ,                                   

Standard Dictionary, having in charge especially the matter of compound
                   ,                                                   

words. His work is entitled “English Compound Words and Phrases.”
     .                      “                                  .”




We shall discuss only two illustrative examples; and they are selected
                                               ;                      

for the purpose of emphasizing the importance of the subject, and the
                                                            ,        

value of common sense in the application of principles governing the
                                                                    

determination of the form words take to express different meanings.
                                                                  .




Our first example may seem to be a somewhat commonplace one, but it
                                                           ,       

may be a helpful illustration. It has been submitted to a large number
                             .                                        

of suitable persons as a test of the general knowledge extant on the
                                                                    

subject among printers, proof-readers, teachers, and writers. The
                      ,      -       ,         ,            .    

result revealed almost complete ignorance of the subject.
                                                        .




Which of the following forms is correct, and why?
                                       ,        ?




  131. (1) back bone, (2) back-bone, (3) backbone.
     . ( )          , ( )     -    , ( )         .




The three forms are correct, but each has a special meaning:
                           ,                               :




1. In the form “back bone,” the word “back” stands in the position of
 .             “         ,”          “    ”                          

an adjective, and is to be interpreted as we interpret any adjective
            ,                                                       

standing before a noun. If we know the meaning of a word thus used, and
                      .                                           ,    

the meaning of the word it precedes, we know the meaning of the two
                                   ,                               

words. “Back” here designates one of two or more bones in a row, say,
     . “    ”                                                  ,    ,

lying on a table.
                .




2. In “back-bone” we have an illustration of a process of the growth
 .    “    -    ”                                                   

of language. Professor W. D. Whitney, the distinguished philologist,
           .            .  .        ,                              ,

says that the composition of words out of independent elements, is more
                                                              ,        

important than any other process in the development of language. The
                                                               .    

stage of development may determine the word’s form.
                                           ’      .




“Back-bone” means the bone of the back, or the spinal column. It is
“    -    ”                           ,                     .      

a type of a large class of hyphenated compounds which are merely
                                                                

elliptical inversions; in this case, the word is such an inversion of
                     ;             ,                                 

_bone of the back_.
                  .




3. “Backbone” is an example of words whose meanings are traceable,
 . “        ”                                                    ,

sometimes readily and sometimes with difficulty, to their parts. It is
                                               ,               .      

easy to understand that a man with a real “back-bone” has _grit_, which
                                          “    -    ”           ,      

is one meaning of “backbone” written as a solid word.
                  “        ”                        .




  NOTE.—Webster’s New International Dictionary does not give
      .—       ’                                            

  the hyphenated form of these two words; notwithstanding this, we
                                        ;                     ,   

  believe this form has the sanction of reason and of convention.
                                                                .




The principles involved in determining the above forms are very simple,
                                                                      ,

and seem self-evident.
             -       .




The process of language-development is rapidly going on; and, as every
                       -                               ;    ,         

corrector of manuscript knows, incorrect forms of words are exceedingly
                             ,                                         

numerous. Often they are made in attempts at short cuts in language.
        .                                                          .

When they may not be changed by the corrector, the hyphen is often
                                             ,                    

useful in revealing their meaning. The use of the hyphen must be based
                                 .                                    

upon reason. Usually, the purpose is to tie together two words to form
           .        ,                                                 

one adjective or one noun.
                         .




The words in our next two illustrative sentences were frequently

were invariably printed improperly; and we shall print them so in the
                                  ;                                  

illustrative sentences:
                      :

                                      “                        .”




Let the hyphen answer the question:
                                  :




  132-1. Dr. Keene is the medical school-inspector of Minneapolis.
     - .   .                            -                        .




  133-1. Mr. Flexner is the medical-school inspector of the Carnegie
     - .   .                       -                                

  Foundation.
            .




In other words, the sentences say that Dr. Keene does _medical_
              ,                          .                     

inspection of schools, and that Mr. Flexner simply inspects medical
                     ,            .                                

schools. As a matter of fact, Mr. Flexner investigated the adequacy of

                                   .




Whether one uses a hyphen in “to-day” or “to-morrow,” or writes
                             “  -   ”    “  -      ,”          

“cannot” as one word or as two words (can not), is a matter of little
“      ”                             (       ),                      

importance; but no educated person should be ignorant of the meanings
          ;                                                          

of words conveyed by the forms in which they are written.

The fundamental principles of compounding words, especially when the
                                               ,                    

meaning of such words is involved, should be understood by pupils
                                 ,                               

in our grade schools. This knowledge is easily acquired; and, once

                “       -   ”                                        .




A few examples will serve to show the beauty and value of compounding

CHAPTER XV
          




CLOSE AND OPEN PUNCTUATION
                          







We shall deal with this subject somewhat as we dealt with compound
                                                                  

words, endeavoring simply to point out the relative values of the
     ,                                                           

“open” and “close” styles of punctuation.
“    ”     “     ”                      .




Almost all writers on punctuation refer to a close open styles
                                                              

of punctuation, but they make no attempt clearly to define or to
              ,                                                 

differentiate these terms. In general, the _close_ style of today is
                         .           ,                              

characterized by a free use of marks where they determine the meaning
                                                                     

of the language, or assist the reader in determining it easily and
               ,                                                  

quickly; the _open_ style omits most marks not actually needed to
       ;                                                         

determine the meaning of the language. The close style may call for too
                                     .                                 

many marks, and the open style for too few, each causing confusion to
          ,                               ,                          

the reader.
          .




It is mainly the comma whose use or omission determines the style of
                                                                    

punctuation; but the use of a semicolon instead of a comma, may also
           ;                                              ,         

differentiate the open from the close style. For instance, the need
                                           .             ,         

of a mark before “and” in Sentence 1 is so unmistakable that the use
                 “   ”                                              

of a comma in such sentence cannot be called close punctuation; but
                                                              ;    

the use of a semicolon in that sentence, as suggested in Chapter 7,
                                       ,                          ,

may properly be called close punctuation. The use of a comma in the
                                        .                          

sentence (see Sentence 1-1) may be considered open punctuation; its
         (              - )                                   ;    

omission would be poor punctuation, but many open punctuators would
                                  ,                                

omit it.
       .




While we must recognize the fact that for some years there has been a
                                                                     

tendency among good writers to use fewer marks, we should disregard any
                                              ,                        

such tendency based upon a lack of appreciation of the value of marks
                                                                     

or, more specifically, upon ignorance of the fine sense relations of
  ,                  ,                                              

language so easily overlooked when not indicated by marks with meanings.
                                                                       .




When two groups of words which, standing alone, take, at least
                              ,               ,     ,         

conventionally, a comma, or even a semicolon, stand together in some
              ,        ,                    ,                       

relation to another group or to a single word, this relation may
                                             ,                  

appear more readily if no mark is used between the two groups. We have
                                                             .        

already discussed such omission between intermediate groups, which are
                                                           ,          

very numerous in both complex and simple language. The principle is
                                                 .                 

illustrated in our next sentence:
                                :




  133. The Lord my Shepard is;
     .                       ;

       I shall be well supplied:
                               :

       Since He is mine and I am His
                                    

       What can I want beside?
                             ?




In the third line of the stanza “and” so manifestly groups the two
                                “   ”                             

clauses between which it stands that a comma is not needed to avoid a
                                                                     

wrong grouping by the reader; and, as each clause is connected in sense
                            ;    ,                                     

with “since,” the omission of a comma between the clauses more readily
     “     ,”                                                         

ties them as a single group to “since.” Of course, the use of a comma
                               “     .”          ,                   

before “and,” which would be good punctuation, would require one at the
       “   ,”                                ,                         

end of the line.
               .




A good close punctuator omits commas from all such groups of words;
                                                                  ;

and a poor open punctuator does the same, but also improperly omits
                                        ,                          

commas and semicolons in many other places.
                                          .




One doing serious composition, or studying punctuation, may well
                             ,                        ,         

punctuate closely as he writes, and afterwards remove all marks whose
                              ,                                      

omission will improve the grouping and not violate good convention. The
                                                                  .    

close punctuator who studiously omits a mark only when he has a reason
                                                                      

to do so will rarely fail to use marks helpfully; the open punctuator
                                                ;                    

who omits marks too freely will write much obscure language and much
                                                                    

more whose meaning is not readily obtainable by the reader.
                                                          .




With this general principle established, the punctuator can readily
                                       ,                           

determine what marks may be omitted; and, far more important, he can
                                   ;    ,                   ,       

adapt to his own language the style of punctuation he prefers to follow.
                                                                       .




The punctuation of our next sentence, taken from an editorial in a
                                    ,                             

recent issue of the _New York Times_, has interest for both the close

the spears and the silver maces; ...
                               ; ...




  By such punctuation the _tank_ is taken out of the _rice-field_; the
                                                          -      ;    

  contrast between _hut_ and _mosque_ is lost; the absence of the comma

  before “where” makes the imaum pray at a particular mosque; not the
         “     ”                                            ;        

  maiden, but her head, is descending the steps; beards are separated

  rank, are put on spear-and mace-bearers.

  And by such punctuation the beauty of the picture is entirely lost in

FOOTNOTES:
         :







[1] For the sake of brevity, we shall frequently use herein the term
[ ]                        ,                                        

_printed_ language to include _written_ language.
                                                .




[2] In order to avoid the too frequent use of a formal word (thus, as
[ ]                                                         (    ,   

follows, etc.), to introduce our illustrative examples, we use the
       ,    .),                                       ,           

colon, thus indicating that the _colon_ relation exists between what
     ,                                                              

precedes and what follows the mark. This somewhat uncommon use of the
                                  .                                  

colon is explained on another page.
                                  .




[3] Sentences herein numbered by hyphenated figures are modifications,
[ ]                                                                  ,

with some exceptions, of preceding sentences designated by the first
                    ,                                               

figures of the hyphenated numbers,—for example, Sentence 1-1 is a
                                 ,—           ,           -      

modification of Sentence 1 in its punctuation.
                                             .




[4] A comma at this point does not appear in the original. We insert it
[ ]                                                      .             

because what follows is clearly explanatory.
                                           .




[5] As Sentence 22 is a quotation, we retain its two-word form of
[ ]                              ,                  -            

“for-ever,” which is the English style; but in No 22-2. which is our
“   -    ,”                           ;             - .             

own language, we use the one-word form, which is the American style.
            ,               -         ,                            .




[6] No mark is used here before “and” because it connects two groups of
[ ]                             “   ”                                  

words, each used as a whole, as indicated by marks of quotation.
     ,                     ,                                   .




[7] See page vi.
[ ]            .




[8] The use of this comma is wrong, for what follows “sentence” is
[ ]                               ,                  “        ”   

clearly restrictive.

The work itself shows that practically nothing has been done to advance

The subject of punctuation seldom receives sufficient attention in

The author takes the ground that the use of a mark of punctuation is

The author knows how to punctuate himself, and he knows how to make the
