CHAPTER █. ████████.


Call me ███████. Some years ago--never ████ how long █████████--having
little or no █████ in my █████, and nothing ██████████ to interest me on
shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the ██████ ████ of
the world. It is a way I have of ███████ off the ██████ and ██████████
the ███████████. ████████ I find myself ███████ ████ about the mouth;
whenever it is a ████, ███████ ████████ in my ████; whenever I find
myself █████████████ ███████ before coffin ██████████, and ████████ up
the ████ of every ███████ I meet; and ██████████ whenever my █████ ███
such an █████ hand of me, that it requires a strong █████ █████████ to
prevent me from ████████████ ████████ into the street, and ████████████
████████ people's ████ off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
as soon as I can. This is my ██████████ for ██████ and ball. With a
█████████████ ████████ ████ ██████ himself upon his sword; I ███████
take to the ship. There is nothing ██████████ in this. If they but ████
it, almost all men in their ██████, some time or other, ███████ very
nearly the same ████████ towards the ocean with me.

There now is your ███████ ████ of the ██████████, ██████ round by
███████ as Indian █████ by █████ █████--████████ █████████ it with
her ████. Right and ████, the ███████ take you █████████. Its ███████
████████ is the ███████, where that noble ████ is ██████ by waves, and
██████ by ███████, which a few █████ ████████ were out of █████ of land.
Look at the ██████ of water-██████ there.

██████████████ the city of a ██████ ███████ afternoon. Go from ████████
████ to ████████ ████, and from ██████, by █████████, northward. What
do you see?--██████ like ██████ █████████ all around the ████, stand
█████████ upon thousands of ██████ men fixed in ocean ████████. Some
███████ against the ██████; some ██████ upon the ████-heads; some
███████ over the ████████ of ships from █████; some high aloft in the
███████, as if ████████ to get a █████ better ███████ ████. But these
are all ████████; of ████ days ████ up in ████ and ███████--tied to
████████, ██████ to ███████, ████████ to █████. How then is this? Are
the green ██████ gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, ██████ ████████ for the water, and
█████████ bound for a ████. ███████! Nothing will ███████ them but the
█████████ █████ of the land; █████████ under the █████ lee of ██████
warehouses will not ███████. No. They must get ████ as ████ the water
as they ████████ can without ███████ in. And there they stand--miles of
them--███████. █████████ all, they come from █████ and ██████, streets
and ███████--north, ████, south, and west. ███ here they all █████.
████ me, ████ the ████████ ██████ of the ███████ of the █████████ of all
those ships ███████ them ███████?

Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of █████. Take
almost any path you please, and ten to one it ███████ you down in a
████, and ██████ you there by a ████ in the stream. There is █████
in it. Let the most ██████-██████ of men be ███████ in his ███████
reveries--stand that man on his ████, set his feet a-█████, and he will
██████████ lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
Should you ever be ███████ in the great American ██████, try this
██████████, if your ███████ ██████ to be supplied with a ████████████
█████████. ███, as every one █████, ██████████ and water are ██████ for
ever.

But here is an ██████. He ███████ to paint you the █████████, ████████,
████████, most ██████████ bit of ████████ █████████ in all the ██████ of
the ████. What is the █████ element he ███████? There stand his █████,
each with a ██████ █████, as if a ██████ and a ████████ were within; and
here sleeps his ██████, and there █████ his ██████; and up from yonder
cottage goes a ██████ █████. Deep into ███████ █████████ █████ a
████ way, ████████ to ███████████ █████ of █████████ ██████ in their
hill-side ████. But though the ███████ ████ ████ ███████, and though
this ████-tree shakes down its █████ like leaves upon this ████████'s
head, yet all were ████, ██████ the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the
magic stream before him. Go visit the ████████ in ████, when for ██████
on scores of miles you ████ ████-deep among █████-██████--what is the
one █████ ███████?--Water--there is not a ████ of water there! Were
███████ but a ████████ of ████, would you ██████ your thousand miles to
see it? ███ did the poor ████ of █████████, upon suddenly █████████ two
████████ of ██████, ██████████ whether to ███ him a coat, which he █████
██████, or ██████ his money in a ██████████ ████ to ████████ █████? Why
is almost every ██████ ███████ ███ with a robust healthy soul in him, at
some time or other █████ to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a
█████████, did you ████████ feel such a ████████ █████████, when first
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the
old ████████ ████ the sea holy? Why did the ██████ give it a ████████
█████, and own brother of ████? ██████ all this is not without ███████.
And still ██████ the meaning of that █████ of █████████, who ███████
he could not █████ the ██████████, ████ █████ he saw in the ████████,
plunged into it and was ███████. But that same image, we █████████ see
in all ██████ and ██████. It is the image of the ███████████ ███████ of
life; and this is the ███ to it all.

Now, when I say that I am in the █████ of going to sea whenever I █████
to grow ████ about the eyes, and begin to be over █████████ of my █████,
I do not ████ to have it ████████ that I ever go to sea as a passenger.
For to go as a passenger you must █████ have a purse, and a purse is
but a ███ unless you have something in it. Besides, ██████████ get
sea-████--grow ███████████--███'t sleep of ██████--do not █████
themselves much, as a ███████ thing;--no, I never go as a passenger;
███, though I am something of a ████, do I ever go to sea as a
Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I ███████ the █████ and ███████████
of such ███████ to those who like them. For my part, I █████████ all
██████████ ███████████ █████, ██████, and ████████████ of every kind
whatsoever. It is █████ as much as I can do to take ████ of myself,
without taking care of ships, ███████, █████, █████████, and what not.
And as for going as cook,--though I ███████ there is ████████████ glory
in that, a cook being a sort of ███████ on ship-board--yet, somehow,
I never fancied ████████ █████;--though once ███████, ███████████
████████, and █████████████ ██████ and ████████, there is no one who
will speak more ████████████, not to say █████████████, of a broiled
████ than I will. It is out of the ██████████ ███████ of the old
█████████ upon broiled ████ and ███████ █████ horse, that you see the
███████ of those creatures in their huge ████-██████ the ████████.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a ██████ ██████, right before the mast,
█████ down into the ██████████, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
True, they ██████ order me about some, and make me ████ from ████ to
spar, like a ███████████ in a May meadow. And at first, this sort
of thing is unpleasant ██████. It ███████ one's █████ of ██████,
████████████ if you come of an old ███████████ ██████ in the land, the
███ ███████████, or █████████, or ████████████. And more than all,
if just previous to ███████ your hand into the ███-███, you have been
███████ it as a country ████████████, making the ███████ ████ stand
in ███ of you. The ██████████ is a ████ one, I ██████ you, from a
schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong █████████ of ██████ and
the ██████ to ██████ you to ████ and ████ it. But even this wears off in
time.

What of it, if some old █████ of a sea-captain ██████ me to get a █████
and █████ down the █████? What does that █████████ ██████ to, ███████,
I mean, in the ██████ of the New █████████? Do you think the █████████
Gabriel ██████ ████████ the less of me, because I ████████ and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular ████████? Who ███'t
a █████? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-████████ may
order me about--however they may █████ and █████ me about, I have the
████████████ of ███████ that it is all right; that █████████ ████ is
one way or other ██████ in much the same way--either in a ████████
or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the █████████ thump is
██████ round, and all hands should ███ each other's ████████-██████, and
be content.

Again, I ██████ go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
██████ me for my trouble, whereas they never ███ passengers a ██████
█████ that I ever █████ of. On the ████████, passengers themselves must
pay. And there is all the ██████████ in the world ███████ paying
and being ████. The ███ of paying is perhaps the most █████████████
██████████ that the two ███████ ███████ ████████ upon us. But BEING
PAID,--what will compare with it? The ██████ ████████ with which a man
████████ money is ██████ ██████████, ███████████ that we so █████████
███████ money to be the root of all ███████ ████, and that on no account
can a ██████ man enter heaven. ██! how ██████████ we ███████ ourselves
to █████████!

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the █████████
████████ and ████ air of the ████-██████ ████. For as in this world,
head winds are far more █████████ than winds from ██████ (that is,
if you never ███████ the ███████████ █████), so for the most part the
Commodore on the ███████-deck ████ his ██████████ at ██████ hand from
the ███████ on the forecastle. He thinks he ████████ it first; but not
so. In much the same way do the ██████████ lead their ███████ in many
other things, at the same time that the leaders little ███████ it.
But █████████ it was that after having ██████████ █████ the sea as a
████████ sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage; this the █████████ ██████ officer of the █████, who has the
████████ ████████████ of me, and ████████ ████ me, and ██████████ me
in some █████████████ way--he can better ██████ than any one else. And,
doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, ██████ part of the grand
█████████ of ██████████ that was █████ up a long time ago. It came in as
a sort of █████ █████████ and ████ between more █████████ ████████████.
I take it that this part of the ████ must have run something like this:


"GRAND █████████ ████████ FOR THE ██████████ OF THE ██████ ██████.

"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.

"BLOODY BATTLE IN ████████████."


Though I cannot tell why it was ███████ that those stage ████████, the
Fates, ███ me down for this ██████ part of a whaling voyage, when others
were set down for ███████████ █████ in high █████████, and short and
████ parts in ███████ ████████, and █████ parts in ██████--though
I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I ██████ all the
█████████████, I think I can see a little into the ███████ and ███████
which being █████████ █████████ to me under ███████ █████████, ███████
me to set about ██████████ the part I did, besides ████████ me into the
████████ that it was a ██████ █████████ from my own ████████ ████████
and ██████████████ ████████.

Chief among these motives was the ████████████ ████ of the great
whale himself. Such a ██████████ and mysterious monster ██████ all my
curiosity. Then the ████ and distant seas where he ██████ his island
bulk; the █████████████, ████████ ██████ of the whale; these, with all
the █████████ ███████ of a thousand ██████████ ██████ and ██████, ██████
to ████ me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not
have been ███████████; but as for me, I am █████████ with an ███████████
████ for things ██████. I love to sail █████████ seas, and land on
█████████ ██████. Not ████████ what is ████, I am █████ to ████████ a
██████, and could still be ██████ with it--would they let me--since it
is but well to be on ████████ █████ with all the ███████ of the █████
one ██████ in.

By ██████ of these things, then, the whaling voyage was ███████; the
great flood-█████ of the ██████-world █████ open, and in the wild
████████ that ██████ me to my purpose, two and two there ███████ into
my ██████ soul, ███████ ███████████ of the whale, and, mid most of them
all, one grand ██████ phantom, like a ████ hill in the air.



CHAPTER █. The ██████-███.


I stuffed a █████ or two into my old carpet-bag, ██████ it under my arm,
and ███████ for ████ ████ and the Pacific. ████████ the good city of
old ████████, I ████ ███████ in New ███████. It was a ████████ night in
████████. Much was I ████████████ upon ████████ that the little ██████
for Nantucket had ███████ ██████, and that no way of reaching that place
would █████, till the █████████ ██████.

As most █████ ██████████ for the pains and █████████ of whaling ████ at
this same New Bedford, thence to ██████ on their voyage, it may as well
be ███████ that I, for one, had no idea of so █████. For my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket █████, because there was a
████, ██████████ something about everything █████████ with that ██████
old island, which █████████ ███████ me. Besides though New Bedford has
of late been █████████ ████████████ the ████████ of whaling, and though
in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
was her great ████████--the ████ of this ████████;--the place where the
first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
did those ██████████ whalemen, the ███-Men, first █████ out in ██████ to
give █████ to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that
first ███████████ little █████ put █████, ██████ █████ with ████████
████████████--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to ████ a ███████ from the ████████?

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
in New Bedford, ███ I could embark for my ████████ ████, it ██████ a
matter of ███████████ where I was to ███ and sleep █████████. It was a
very ███████-looking, ███, a very ████ and ██████ night, ████████ ████
and █████████. I knew no one in the place. With ███████ ████████ I had
███████ my ██████, and only brought up a few ██████ of silver,--So,
████████ you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I █████ in the ██████ of
a ██████ street ███████████ my bag, and █████████ the █████ towards the
north with the ████████ towards the south--wherever in your ██████ you
may ████████ to █████ for the night, my ████ Ishmael, be sure to ███████
the █████, and don't be too particular.

With ███████ █████ I █████ the streets, and passed the ████ of "The
███████ ████████"--but it ██████ too █████████ and jolly there. ███████
on, from the bright red ███████ of the "Sword-Fish ███," there came such
███████ ████, that it seemed to have ██████ the ██████ snow and ███ from
before the █████, for ██████████ else the █████████ █████ lay ten ██████
█████ in a ████, █████████ ████████,--rather █████ for me, when I struck
my ████ against the ██████ ███████████, because from hard, ███████████
███████ the █████ of my █████ were in a most █████████ ██████. Too
expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to █████ the
█████ █████ in the street, and hear the sounds of the ████████ glasses
within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at ████; don't you hear? get away
from before the ████; your ███████ boots are ████████ the way. So on I
████. I now by ████████ ████████ the streets that ████ me waterward, for
there, doubtless, were the ████████, if not the █████████ ████.

Such dreary streets! ██████ of █████████, not houses, on either hand,
and here and there a ██████, like a candle moving about in a ████. At
this ████ of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
the town ██████ all but ████████. But █████████ I came to a █████ █████
██████████ from a ███, wide ████████, the door of which stood ██████████
open. It had a ████████ look, as if it were █████ for the ████ of the
██████; so, ████████, the first thing I did was to ███████ over an
███-███ in the █████. ██! thought I, ha, as the ██████ █████████ almost
██████ me, are these █████ from that destroyed city, ████████? But "The
Crossed Harpoons," and "The Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the
sign of "The ████." However, I ██████ myself up and ███████ a ████ voice
within, ██████ on and ██████ a second, ████████ door.

It seemed the great █████ Parliament ███████ in ██████. A hundred black
█████ ██████ round in their ████ to ████; and ██████, a black █████
of ████ was beating a book in a ██████. It was a █████ ██████; and the
████████'s ████ was about the blackness of darkness, and the ███████ and
███████ and teeth-████████ there. Ha, Ishmael, ████████ I, ███████ out,
████████ █████████████ at the sign of 'The Trap!'

Moving on, I at last came to a ███ sort of light not far from the █████,
and heard a ███████ ████████ in the air; and looking up, saw a ████████
sign over the door with a white ████████ upon it, ███████ ████████████
a ████ straight ███ of █████ █████, and these █████ ██████████--"The
███████ Inn:--█████ Coffin."

Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ███████ in that particular █████████, thought
I. But it is a ██████ name in Nantucket, they say, and I ███████ this
Peter here is an ████████ from there. As the light looked so dim, and
the place, for the time, looked █████ enough, and the ███████████ little
██████ house itself looked as if it might have been ██████ here from
the █████ of some █████ ████████, and as the swinging sign had a
███████-████████ sort of █████ to it, I thought that here was the very
████ for █████ ████████, and the best of ███ ██████.

It was a queer sort of place--a █████-█████ old house, one side ███████
as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a █████ █████ ██████,
where that ███████████ wind ██████████ ████ up a █████ ███████ than ever
it did about poor ████'s ██████ craft. Euroclydon, ████████████, is a
mighty ████████ ██████ to any one in-█████, with his feet on the ███
quietly ████████ for ███. "In ███████ of that tempestuous wind called
Euroclydon," ████ an old ██████--of whose works I ███████ the only ████
██████--"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou ███████ out at
it from a █████ ██████ where the frost is all on the ███████, or whether
thou █████████ it from that ████████ window, where the frost is on ████
sides, and of which the █████ Death is the only ███████." True enough,
thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou
█████████ well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of ████ is
the house. What a ████ they ████'t stop up the ██████ and the ████████
though, and ██████ in a little ████ here and there. But it's too late
to make any ████████████ now. The ████████ is ████████; the █████████
is on, and the █████ were carted off a ███████ years ago. Poor ███████
there, ██████████ his teeth against the █████████ for his ██████, and
███████ off his ███████ with his ██████████, he might ████ up both ████
with ████, and put a ████-███ into his mouth, and yet that would not
████ out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old █████, in his
red ██████ ███████--(he had a ██████ one ██████████) ████, pooh! What
a fine ██████ night; how █████ ████████; what northern ██████! Let them
████ of their ████████ summer ██████ of everlasting ██████████████; give
me the █████████ of making my own summer with my own █████.

But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by ███████ them up
to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in ███████
than here? Would he not far rather lay him down ██████████ █████ the
line of the ███████; ███, ye ████! go down to the █████ ███ itself, in
order to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
door of Dives, this is more █████████ than that an ███████ should be
██████ to one of the ████████. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a
████ in an ice ██████ made of ██████ sighs, and being a █████████ of a
██████████ ███████, he only ██████ the █████ tears of ███████.

But no more of this ██████████ now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
██████ of that yet to come. Let us ██████ the ice from our ███████ feet,
and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.



CHAPTER █. The Spouter-Inn.


Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, ██████████ █████ with old-█████████ █████████, █████████ one of
the bulwarks of some █████████ old craft. On one side ████ a very large
███████████ so ██████████ ████████, and every way ███████, that in the
███████ ███████████ by which you ██████ it, it was only by ████████
█████ and a ██████ of ██████████ ██████ to it, and ███████ ███████ of
the █████████, that you could any way ██████ at an █████████████ of its
purpose. Such unaccountable ██████ of ██████ and ███████, that at first
you almost thought some █████████ young artist, in the time of the New
███████ ████, had ██████████ to █████████ chaos █████████. But by ████
of much and ███████ █████████████, and oft ████████ ██████████, and
especially by ████████ open the little window towards the back of the
entry, you at last come to the ██████████ that such an idea, however
wild, might not be altogether ███████████.

But what most ███████ and ██████████ you was a long, ██████, portentous,
black mass of something ████████ in the ██████ of the picture over three
blue, dim, █████████████ █████ floating in a nameless █████. A █████,
█████, ████████ picture █████, enough to █████ a ███████ man ██████████.
Yet was there a sort of ██████████, half-████████, ████████████
█████████ about it that ██████ █████ you to it, till you involuntarily
took an ████ with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
meant. Ever and ████ a bright, but, ████, █████████ idea would dart you
through.--It's the Black Sea in a ████████ gale.--It's the █████████
██████ of the four ██████ ████████.--It's a ███████ █████.--It's a
███████████ ██████ █████.--It's the ████████-up of the ████████ stream
of Time. But at last all these ███████ ███████ to that one portentous
something in the picture's █████. THAT once found out, and all the ████
were █████. But stop; does it not bear a █████ ███████████ to a ████████
fish? even the great leviathan himself?

In ████, the artist's ██████ seemed this: a █████ ██████ of my own,
partly █████ upon the ██████████ ████████ of many ████ persons with whom
I █████████ upon the ███████. The picture ██████████ a Cape-██████ in a
great █████████; the half-█████████ ship █████████ there with its three
██████████ masts alone ███████; and an ███████████ whale, █████████ to
██████ █████ over the craft, is in the enormous act of ████████ himself
upon the three mast-heads.

The ████████ ████ of this entry was hung all over with a ██████████
█████ of monstrous █████ and ██████. Some were ███████ set with
██████████ teeth ██████████ █████ saws; others were ██████ with █████ of
█████ ████; and one was ██████-██████, with a vast ██████ ████████ round
like the ███████ made in the new-████ █████ by a long-armed █████. You
█████████ as you █████, and ████████ what monstrous ████████ and ██████
could ever have gone a death-██████████ with such a ███████, ██████████
█████████. █████ with these were █████ old whaling ██████ and harpoons
all ██████ and ████████. Some were storied weapons. With this once long
lance, now ██████ ███████, fifty years ago did ██████ █████ kill fifteen
whales between a sunrise and a ██████. And that harpoon--so like a
█████████ now--was █████ in █████ seas, and run away with by a whale,
years afterwards █████ off the Cape of ██████. The original ████ ███████
nigh the tail, and, like a restless ██████ ██████████ in the body of a
man, █████████ full forty feet, and at last was found ████████ in the
████.

████████ this █████ entry, and on through ███ low-arched way--cut
through what in old █████ must have been a great ███████ ███████ with
██████████ all round--you enter the public ████. A still ███████ place
is this, with such low ponderous █████ above, and such old ████████
██████ beneath, that you would almost █████ you ████ some old craft's
████████, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-████████
old ███ ██████ so █████████. On one side stood a long, low, █████-like
█████ covered with ███████ glass █████, ██████ with █████ ████████
gathered from this wide world's ████████ █████. ██████████ from the
further █████ of the room ██████ a dark-looking ███--the ███--a ████
███████ at a right whale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the
vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a █████ might almost drive
beneath it. Within are shabby ███████, ██████ round with old █████████,
███████, ██████; and in those jaws of █████ destruction, like another
██████ Jonah (by which name ██████ they called him), ███████ a little
████████ old man, who, for their money, ██████ █████ the sailors
█████████ and death.

██████████ are the ████████ into which he █████ his ██████. Though
true █████████ without--within, the █████████ green ████████ glasses
███████████ ███████ █████████ to a ████████ ██████. ████████ █████████
██████ ██████ into the glass, ████████ these ████████' ███████. ████ to
THIS ████, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so
on to the full glass--the Cape Horn ███████, which you may gulp down for
a ████████.

Upon entering the place I found a ██████ of young ██████ gathered about
a table, █████████ by a dim light ██████ █████████ of ████████████. I
██████ the ████████, and ███████ him I ███████ to be ████████████ with a
room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed ██████████.
"But █████," he █████, ███████ his ████████, "you █████ no ██████████
to ███████ a harpooneer's ███████, have ye? I s'████ you are ████'
a-██████', so you'd better get ████ to that sort of thing."

I told him that I never █████ to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
ever do so, it would ██████ upon who the harpooneer might be, and
that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
harpooneer was not █████████ █████████████, why rather than ██████
further about a strange town on so ██████ a night, I would put up with
the half of any ██████ man's blanket.

"I thought so. All right; take a ████. ██████?--you ████ supper?
Supper'██ be █████ directly."

I sat down on an old wooden ██████, ██████ all over like a █████ on the
Battery. At one ███ a ██████████ tar was still further ████████ it with
his ████-█████, ████████ over and ██████████ ███████ away at the █████
between his legs. He was ██████ his hand at a ship under full sail, but
he didn't make much ███████, I thought.

At last some four or ████ of us were ████████ to our ████ in an
█████████ room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
said he ██████'t afford it. Nothing but two dismal ██████ ███████, each
in a ███████ █████. We were ████ to ██████ up our ██████ ███████, and
hold to our ████ ████ of ████████ ███ with our half frozen ███████. But
the fare was of the most ███████████ kind--not only ████ and ████████,
but █████████; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in
a green box coat, █████████ himself to these dumplings in a most ███████
manner.

"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the █████████ to a dead
█████████."

"Landlord," I █████████, "that ████ the harpooneer is it?"

"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of ████████████ █████, "the harpooneer
is a dark ████████████ ████. He never ████ dumplings, he don't--he eats
nothing but ██████, and he █████ '██ rare."

"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?"

"He'll be here █████ long," was the answer.

I could not ████ it, but I █████ to feel ██████████ of this "dark
complexioned" harpooneer. At any ████, I made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together, he must ███████ and get into
bed before I did.

Supper over, the ███████ went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, I ████████ to █████ the rest of the ███████
as a ██████ on.

Presently a ███████ noise was heard without. ████████ up, the landlord
█████, "That's the ███████'s crew. I ████ her ████████ in the ██████
this ███████; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. ██████, boys; now
we'll have the ██████ ████ from the ███████."

A ████████ of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
and in rolled a wild set of ████████ enough. █████████ in their ██████
watch █████, and with their heads ███████ in ███████ ██████████, all
████████ and ██████, and their ██████ █████ with ███████, they seemed an
████████ of █████ from ████████. They had just ██████ from their boat,
and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they
made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled
little old Jonah, there ███████████, soon ██████ them out ████████ all
round. One ██████████ of a ███ cold in his head, upon which Jonah
mixed him a █████-like ██████ of ███ and ████████, which he █████ was a
█████████ ████ for all █████ and ████████ whatsoever, never mind of how
long ████████, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
███████ side of an ice-island.

The ██████ soon ███████ into their heads, as it generally does even
with the █████████ ██████ █████ landed from sea, and they began ████████
about most ██████████████.

I observed, however, that one of them ████ ████████ █████, and though
he seemed ████████ not to █████ the ████████ of his █████████ by his own
█████ ████, yet upon the █████ he █████████ from making as much noise
as the rest. This man ██████████ me at once; and since the sea-gods
had ████████ that he should soon ██████ my ████████ (though but a
████████-███████ one, so far as this narrative is █████████), I will
here venture upon a little ███████████ of him. He stood full six feet
in ██████, with noble shoulders, and a █████ like a ██████-███. I have
seldom seen such █████ in a man. His face was ██████ █████ and burnt,
making his white teeth ████████ by the ████████; while in the deep
shadows of his eyes floated some █████████████ that did not seem to give
him much joy. His voice at once █████████ that he was a ██████████,
and from his fine ███████, I thought he must be one of those tall
████████████ from the ███████████ █████ in ████████. When the ███████
of his ██████████ had mounted to its height, this man ███████ away
██████████, and I saw no more of him till he became my ███████ on the
sea. In a few ███████, however, he was ██████ by his shipmates, and
being, it seems, for some reason a huge █████████ with them, they ██████
a ███ of "██████████! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and ██████ out of
the house in pursuit of him.

It was now about nine o'█████, and the room ███████ almost
██████████████ quiet after these ██████, I began to ████████████ myself
upon a little ████ that had occurred to me just previous to the ████████
of the seamen.

No man ███████ to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't ████ how it is, but
people like to be ███████ when they are sleeping. And when it █████ to
sleeping with an ███████ ████████, in a strange inn, in a strange
town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections ████████████
████████. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed, more than ███████ else; for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea, than ████████ █████ do ashore. To be sure they
all sleep together in one █████████, but you have your own ███████, and
█████ yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own ████.

The more I ████████ over this harpooneer, the more I ██████████ the
thought of sleeping with him. It was ████ to ███████ that being a
harpooneer, his █████ or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
the ███████, █████████ ████ of the ██████. I began to ██████ all over.
Besides, it was ███████ late, and my decent harpooneer █████ to be
home and going ████████. Suppose now, he should ██████ in upon me at
midnight--how could I tell from what ████ ████ he had been coming?

"Landlord! I'██ ███████ my mind about that harpooneer.--I ████'t sleep
with him. I'll try the bench here."

"Just as you please; I'█ █████ I ████ █████ ye a ██████████ for a
████████, and it's a ██████ █████ board here"--███████ of the knots and
███████. "But ████ a bit, Skrimshander; I've ███ a █████████'s █████
there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye ████ enough." So ██████
he ████████ the plane; and with his old ████ handkerchief first dusting
the bench, ██████████ set to ███████ away at my bed, the while ████████
like an ███. The ████████ ████ right and left; till at last the
plane-iron came ████ against an ██████████████ ████. The landlord was
near █████████ his █████, and I told him for heaven's ████ to ████--the
bed was ████ enough to ████ me, and I did not know how all the planing
in the world could make █████ down of a pine █████. So █████████ up the
shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
brown study.

I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
short; but that could be ██████ with a █████. But it was a foot too
██████, and the other bench in the room was about four inches ██████
than the ██████ one--so there was no ██████ them. I then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
leaving a little ████████ between, for my back to settle down in. But I
soon found that there came such a ███████ of cold air over me from under
the ████ of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially
as another ███████ from the ███████ door ███ the one from the window,
and both together formed a series of small ██████████ in the █████████
vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.

The devil █████ that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I █████
a █████ on him--████ his door ██████, and jump into his bed, not to be
███████ by the most ███████ █████████? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
second ████████ I █████████ it. For who could tell but what the ████
morning, so soon as I ██████ out of the room, the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry, all ready to █████ me down!

Still, looking round me again, and ██████ no possible chance of ████████
a ██████████ night unless in some other ██████'s bed, I began to think
that after all I might be ██████████ █████████████ ██████████ against
this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait ██████; he must be ████████
in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may
become jolly good ██████████ after all--there's no telling.

But though the other ████████ kept coming in by ████, ████, and ██████,
and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.

"Landlord!" said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such
late hours?" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.

The landlord ████████ again with his ████ ███████, and seemed to
be ████████ ███████ at something beyond my █████████████. "No," he
answered, "generally he's an █████ bird--██████ to bed and airley to
████--yes, he's the bird what ███████ the worm. But to-night he went out
a ████████, you see, and I don't see what on █████ █████ him so late,
unless, may be, he can't ████ his head."

"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a ████████████ story is this you
are telling me?" getting into a ████████ ████. "Do you ███████ to say,
landlord, that this harpooneer is ████████ engaged this ███████ Saturday
night, or rather ██████ morning, in peddling his head around this town?"

"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't
sell it here, the ██████'s ███████████."

"With what?" ███████ I.

"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"

"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite ██████, "you'd better
stop ████████ that ████ to me--I'm not green."

"May be not," taking out a █████ and █████████ a █████████, "but I
███████ █████ you'll be ████ BROWN if that ere harpooneer █████ you a
█████████' his head."

"I'll █████ it for him," said I, now flying into a ███████ again at this
unaccountable ███████ of the landlord's.

"It's █████ a'ready," said he.

"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"

"███████, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."

"Landlord," said I, going up to him as ████ as ██. █████ in a
snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must ██████████ one
another, and that too without █████. I come to your house and want a
bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
███████ to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I
have not yet seen, you ███████ in telling me the most ██████████ and
████████████ ███████ ███████ to █████ in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my █████████--a sort of connexion,
landlord, which is an ████████ and ████████████ one in the ███████
degree. I now ██████ of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all ████████ ████ to spend the
night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to █████
that story about ███████ his head, which if true I take to be good
████████ that this harpooneer is █████ mad, and I've no idea of sleeping
with a ██████; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying
to ██████ me to do so █████████, would ███████ ██████ yourself ██████ to
a ████████ ███████████."

"Wall," said the landlord, ████████ a long breath, "that's a █████ long
██████ for a chap that ████ a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
this here harpooneer I have been ██████' you of has just arrived from
the south seas, where he ██████ up a ███ of '██████ New ███████ heads
(great ██████, you know), and he's ████ all on 'em but one, and that one
he's trying to sell to-night, █████ to-██████'s Sunday, and it would not
do to be ██████' human heads about the streets when █████ is goin' to
████████. He ██████ to, last Sunday, but I ███████ him just as he was
goin' out of the door with four heads ██████ on a ██████, for all the
airth like a string of ██████."

This account ███████ up the █████████ unaccountable ███████, and ██████
that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of ███████ me--but at
the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who ██████ out of a
Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead █████████?

"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."

"He ████ ███'███," was the █████████. "But come, it's getting dreadful
late, you had better be turning ██████--it's a ████ bed; ███ and me
█████ in that ere bed the night we were ███████. There's plenty of room
for two to ████ about in that bed; it's an ████████ ███ bed that. Why,
afore we give it up, Sal used to put our ███ and little ██████ in the
foot of it. But I got a ████████ and █████████ about one night, and
somehow, Sam got ███████ on the █████, and came near breaking his arm.
█████ that, Sal said it ██████'t do. Come along here, I'll give ye a
████ in a █████;" and so saying he ███████ a candle and held it towards
me, ████████ to lead the way. But I stood ██████████; when looking at a
clock in the corner, he exclaimed "I ███ it's Sunday--you ███'t see that
harpooneer to-night; he's come to ██████ somewhere--come along then; DO
come; WON'T ye come?"

I ██████████ the matter a moment, and then up ██████ we went, and I was
███████ into a small room, cold as a ████, and █████████, sure enough,
with a ██████████ bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
to sleep ███████.

"There," said the landlord, ███████ the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did ██████ ████ as a ████-stand and centre table; "there, make
yourself ███████████ now, and good night to ye." I turned round from
██████ the bed, but he had ███████████.

███████ back the ███████████, I ███████ over the bed. Though none of the
most ███████, it yet stood the ████████ █████████ well. I then ███████
round the room; and besides the ████████ and centre table, could see
no other █████████ █████████ to the place, but a rude shelf, the four
█████, and a ███████ █████████ representing a man striking a whale. Of
things not ████████ belonging to the room, there was a hammock ██████
up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large ██████'s bag,
██████████ the harpooneer's ████████, no doubt in ████ of a land trunk.
████████, there was a ██████ of ██████████ bone fish █████ on the shelf
over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.

But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
light, and ████ it, and smelt it, and █████ every way possible to arrive
at some ████████████ conclusion ██████████ it. I can compare it to
nothing but a large door ███, ██████████ at the █████ with little
tinkling ████ something like the ███████ █████████ ██████ round an
Indian ████████. There was a hole or ████ in the middle of this mat,
as you see the same in South American ███████. But could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and ██████ the
streets of any Christian town in that sort of █████? I put it on, to try
it, and it weighed me down like a ██████, being ██████████ shaggy and
thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer
had been ███████ it of a █████ day. I went up in it to a bit of glass
█████ against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I ████
myself out of it in such a █████ that I ████ myself a ████ in the ████.

I sat down on the side of the bed, and █████████ ████████ about this
head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey ██████, and then stood in
the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought
a little more in my shirt ███████. But █████████ to feel very cold now,
half █████████ as I was, and ███████████ what the landlord said about
the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very
late, I made no more ███, but ██████ out of my ██████████ and boots, and
then ███████ out the light ███████ into bed, and █████████ myself to the
care of heaven.

Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-████ or broken ████████,
there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep
for a long time. At last I ████ off into a light ████, and had pretty
nearly made a good offing towards the land of ███, when I heard a █████
████████ in the passage, and saw a ███████ of light come into the room
from under the door.

Lord ████ me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the ████████
head-███████. But I lay █████████ still, and resolved not to say a word
till ██████ to. Holding a light in one hand, and that █████████ New
Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
floor in one corner, and then began working away at the ███████ █████
of the large bag I before █████ of as being in the room. I was all
█████████ to see his face, but he kept it ███████ for some time while
████████ in ████████ the bag's mouth. This ████████████, however, he
turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of
a dark, ████████, ██████ colour, here and there stuck over with large
████████ looking ███████. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a ████████
bedfellow; he's been in a █████, got ██████████ cut, and here he is,
just from the ███████. But at that moment he ███████ to turn his face
so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
████████-████████ at all, those black squares on his ██████. They were
██████ of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
but soon an ███████ of the █████ occurred to me. I ██████████ a story of
a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the █████████, had been
████████ by them. I █████████ that this harpooneer, in the ██████ of his
distant voyages, must have met with a ███████ █████████. And what is it,
thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be ██████ in any
sort of skin. But then, what to make of his █████████ ██████████, that
part of it, I mean, █████ round about, and ██████████ ███████████ of the
squares of █████████. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of
████████ ███████; but I never heard of a ███ ███'s tanning a white man
into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;
and perhaps the sun there ████████ these █████████████ ███████ upon the
skin. Now, while all these █████ were ███████ through me like lightning,
this harpooneer never ███████ me at all. But, after some ██████████
having opened his bag, he commenced ████████ in it, and presently ██████
out a sort of ████████, and a ████-skin ██████ with the hair on. Placing
these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New
Zealand head--a ███████ thing enough--and ███████ it down into the bag.
He now took off his ███--a new ██████ hat--when I came nigh ███████ out
with fresh ████████. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at
least--nothing but a small █████-knot ███████ up on his forehead. His
████ purplish head now looked for all the world like a ████████ █████.
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have ██████
out of it ███████ than ever I bolted a ██████.

Even as it was, I thought something of ████████ out of the window, but
it was the second floor back. I am no ██████, but what to make of
this head-peddling ██████ ██████ altogether passed my comprehension.
Ignorance is the ██████ of fear, and being completely ██████████ and
confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him
as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not
████ enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed ████████████ in him.

Meanwhile, he █████████ the business of ██████████, and at last showed
his chest and ████. As I ████, these covered parts of him were █████████
with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same
dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' ███, and just
███████ from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very
legs were ██████, as if a parcel of dark green █████ were ███████ up
the ██████ of young █████. It was now quite plain that he must be some
abominable savage or other ███████ ██████ of a whaleman in the South
Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I ██████ to think of it.
A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own ████████. He might
take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!

But there was no time for ██████████, for now the savage went about
something that completely ██████████ my █████████, and █████████ me that
he must indeed be a ███████. Going to his heavy █████, or ███████, or
███████████, which he had ██████████ hung on a chair, he ███████ in the
███████, and produced at length a ███████ little deformed image with
a █████ on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old █████
████. Remembering the ████████ head, at first I almost thought that
this black ███████ was a ████ baby preserved in some similar manner. But
seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it █████████ a good deal
like ████████ █████, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
████, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the
empty fire-place, and ████████ the papered fire-board, ████ up this
little hunch-██████ image, like a ██████, between the ████████. The
chimney █████ and all the ██████ inside were very █████, so that I
thought this fire-place made a very ███████████ little ██████ or ██████
for his Congo idol.

I now ███████ my eyes hard towards the half ██████ image, feeling but
███ at ████ ████████--to see what was next to ██████. First he █████
about a double ███████ of shavings out of his grego pocket, and ██████
them █████████ before the idol; then laying a bit of ship ███████ on
███ and ████████ the █████ from the ████, he ███████ the shavings into
a ███████████ █████. Presently, after many █████ ████████ into the fire,
and still ███████ ███████████ of his fingers (███████ he seemed to be
█████████ them █████), he at last █████████ in ███████ out the biscuit;
then blowing off the ████ and ashes a little, he made a ██████ offer of
it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such
███ sort of fare at all; he never █████ his lips. All these strange
██████ were ███████████ by still stranger ████████ ██████ from the
███████, who seemed to be ███████ in a sing-song or else singing some
█████ ████████ or other, ██████ which his face ████████ about in the
most unnatural manner. At last █████████████ the fire, he took the idol
up very ███████████████, and ██████ it again in his grego pocket as
██████████ as if he were a █████████ ███████ a dead ████████.

All these queer ███████████ █████████ my █████████████████, and
seeing him now ██████████ strong ████████ of ██████████ his business
██████████, and ███████ into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
now or never, before the light was put out, to break the █████ in which
I had so long been bound.

But the interval I █████ in ████████████ what to say, was a █████ one.
Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he ████████ the head of it for an
instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
he ██████ out great ██████ of ███████ smoke. The next moment the light
was ████████████, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,
██████ into bed with me. I ████ out, I could not help it now; and ██████
a ██████ █████ of astonishment he began feeling me.

██████████ out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
against the wall, and then ████████ him, ███████ or whatever he might
be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his
guttural █████████ █████████ me at once that he but ill ████████████ my
meaning.

"Who-e █████ you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e."
And so saying the lighted tomahawk began ███████████ about me in the
dark.

"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I. "Landlord! Watch!
Coffin! ██████! save me!"

"Speak-e! tell-██ me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again ███████ the
cannibal, while his horrid ████████████ of the tomahawk █████████ the
hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
But █████ heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand, and leaping from the bed I ███ up to him.

"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "████████ here wouldn't
████ a hair of your head."

"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"

"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a ███████' heads
around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
here--you ██████ me, I sabbee--you this man ██████ you--you sabbee?"

"Me sabbee plenty"--███████ Queequeg, ███████ away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

"You ██████ in," he added, █████████ to me with his tomahawk, and
throwing the ███████ to one side. He really did this in not only a █████
but a really kind and ██████████ way. I stood looking at him a moment.
For all his ██████████ he was on the whole a clean, ██████ looking
cannibal. What's all this ████ I have been making about, thought I to
myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason
to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober
cannibal than a ███████ Christian.

"Landlord," said I, "tell him to █████ his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
whatever you call it; tell him to stop ███████, in short, and I will
turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.
It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't ███████."

This being told to Queequeg, he at once ████████, and again ████████
████████ me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to
say--"I won't █████ a ███ of ye."

"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."

I turned in, and never slept better in my life.



CHAPTER █. The Counterpane.


Upon ██████ next morning about ████████, I found Queequeg's arm thrown
over me in the most ██████ and ████████████ manner. You had almost
thought I had been his ████. The counterpane was of █████████, full of
███ little █████-████████ squares and █████████; and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an ████████████ ██████ █████████ of a ██████,
no two parts of which were of one ███████ █████--█████ I suppose to
his ███████ his arm at sea ██████████████ in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves ███████████ rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I
say, looked for all the world like a █████ of that same patchwork █████.
Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first █████, I could
██████ tell it from the quilt, they so ███████ their ████ together; and
it was only by the sense of weight and ████████ that I could tell that
Queequeg was ███████ me.

My ██████████ were strange. Let me try to ███████ them. When I was a
█████, I well ████████ a somewhat similar ████████████ that ██████ me;
whether it was a ███████ or a █████, I never could entirely settle.
The circumstance was this. I had been ███████ up some █████ or other--I
think it was trying to █████ up the chimney, as I had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous; and my ██████████ who, somehow or other,
was all the time ████████ me, or ███████ me to bed ██████████,--my
██████ ███████ me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the ████ June,
the ███████ day in the year in our ██████████. I felt dreadfully. But
there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
█████ floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter ████ got between the ██████.

I lay there ████████ ███████████ that ███████ ██████ hours must ██████
before I could ████ for a ████████████. Sixteen hours in bed! the
small of my back █████ to think of it. And it was so light too; the
sun ███████ in at the window, and a great ████████ of ███████ in the
streets, and the █████ of gay ██████ all over the house. I felt worse
and worse--at last I got up, ███████, and ██████ going down in my
██████████ feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself
at her feet, ██████████ her as a particular ██████ to give me a good
██████████ for my ████████████; anything indeed but ██████████ me to lie
████ such an ███████████ length of time. But she was the best and most
█████████████ of ███████████, and back I had to go to my room. For
several hours I lay there broad █████, feeling a great deal worse than I
have ever done since, even from the ████████ ██████████ ███████████. At
last I must have ██████ into a ████████ nightmare of a doze; and slowly
waking from it--half ███████ in ██████--I opened my eyes, and the before
sun-███ room was now ███████ in █████ darkness. █████████ I felt a █████
running through all my █████; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was
to be heard; but a ████████████ hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung
over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form
or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed ███████ seated by my
bed-side. For what seemed ████ █████ on ages, I lay there, frozen with
the most █████ █████, not ██████ to ████ away my hand; yet ever thinking
that if I could but ████ it one single ████, the horrid spell would be
broken. I knew not how this █████████████ at last ██████ away from me;
but waking in the morning, I ████████████ remembered it all, and for
days and █████ and ██████ afterwards I lost myself in ███████████
████████ to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I █████ ██████
myself with it.

Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their ███████████, to
those which I ███████████ on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
arm thrown round me. But at length all the ████ night's ██████ ███████
████████, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only █████ to
the ███████ ███████████. For though I tried to ████ his arm--██████ his
██████████ █████--yet, sleeping as he was, he still ██████ me ███████,
as though ██████ but death should part us █████. I now ██████ to █████
him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a █████. I then rolled over,
my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-██████; and suddenly felt a
██████ ███████. Throwing █████ the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a ███████-█████ baby. A
pretty ██████, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the
broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! "Queequeg!--in the name of
████████, Queequeg, wake!" At length, by dint of much █████████, and
loud and █████████ ██████████████ upon the ██████████████ of his
hugging a fellow male in that ███████████ sort of █████, I succeeded in
██████████ a grunt; and presently, he ████ back his arm, █████ himself
all over like a ████████████ ███ just from the water, and sat up in bed,
stiff as a ████-█████, looking at me, and ███████ his eyes as if he
did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly ███████ over
him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no ███████ ██████████
now, and ████ upon ████████ observing so curious a ████████. When, at
last, his mind seemed made up touching the █████████ of his bedfellow,
and he became, as it were, ██████████ to the fact; he jumped out upon
the floor, and by certain █████ and sounds gave me to understand that,
if it pleased me, he would █████ first and then █████ me to dress
afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,
under the circumstances, this is a very █████████ ████████; but, the
truth is, these savages have an ██████ sense of ████████, say what
you will; it is marvellous how ███████████ polite they are. I pay this
particular ██████████ to Queequeg, because he ███████ me with so much
████████ and consideration, while I was ██████ of great ████████;
███████ at him from the bed, and ████████ all his ████████ ███████; for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my ████████. Nevertheless,
a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ████ were well
█████ ███████ █████████.

He commenced ████████ at top by ███████ his beaver hat, a very tall one,
by the by, and then--still █████ his ████████--he ██████ up his boots.
What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
████████ was to █████ himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;
when, from ██████ violent ████████ and ██████████, I inferred he was
hard at work ███████ himself; though by no ███ of █████████ that I ever
heard of, is any man ████████ to be private when putting on his
boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
stage--███████ ███████████ nor █████████. He was just enough civilized
to ████ off his ██████████████ in the █████████ possible ███████. His
█████████ was not yet █████████. He was an █████████████. If he had not
been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
he never would have ██████ of getting under the bed to put them on. At
last, he emerged with his hat very much ██████ and ███████ down over his
eyes, and began creaking and ███████ about the room, as if, not
being much ██████████ to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled ███████
ones--probably not made to order either--rather ███████ and tormented
him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.

Seeing, now, that there were no ████████ to the window, and that the
street being very narrow, the house opposite █████████ a plain view
into the room, and observing more and more the ██████████ figure that
Queequeg made, ███████ about with little else but his hat and boots on;
I ██████ him as well as I could, to ██████████ his ██████ somewhat,
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He
complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the
morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to
my █████████, █████████ himself with ███████████ his █████████ to his
chest, arms, and hands. He then ██████ his █████████, and taking up a
█████ of hard ████ on the wash-stand centre table, ██████ it into water
and commenced █████████ his face. I was watching to see where he kept
his █████, when ██ and ██████, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,
█████ out the long wooden █████, ██████████ the head, █████ it a little
on his ████, and ████████ up to the bit of ██████ against the wall,
██████ a ████████ ████████, or rather ██████████ of his cheeks. Thinks
I, Queequeg, this is █████ ██████'s best ███████ with a █████████.
Afterwards I wondered the less at this █████████ when I came to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how ███████████ sharp
the long straight edges are always kept.

The rest of his toilet was soon ████████, and he ███████ ███████ out of
the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
harpoon like a ███████'s █████.



CHAPTER █. █████████.


I ███████ followed suit, and ██████████ into the bar-room ████████ the
grinning landlord very ██████████. I █████████ no ██████ towards him,
though he had been ██████████ with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellow.

However, a good █████ is a mighty good thing, and rather too ██████ a
good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his own
██████ person, afford █████ for a good ████ to anybody, let him not be
████████, but let him cheerfully █████ himself to spend and be spent in
that way. And the man that has anything ███████████ █████████ about him,
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.

The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
nearly all whalemen; chief █████, and second mates, and third mates, and
sea ██████████, and sea ███████, and sea ███████████, and harpooneers,
and ship ███████; a brown and ██████ company, with █████ beards; an
███████, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning █████.

You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
young fellow's healthy █████ is like a sun-███████ ████ in ███, and
would seem to smell almost as █████; he cannot have been three days
landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him █████ a few shades
███████; you might say a touch of █████ wood is in him. In the
complexion of a third still ███████ a ██████ ████, but ████████ ████████
██████; HE doubtless has ███████ whole weeks ashore. But who could show
a cheek like Queequeg? which, ██████ with various █████, seemed like the
█████' ███████ █████, to show forth in one array, ███████████ ████████,
████ by zone.

"Grub, ██!" now cried the landlord, ████████ open a door, and in we went
to breakfast.

They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: ███████,
the great New England █████████, and █████ ████, the ██████ one; of all
men, they possessed the least █████████ in the ██████. But perhaps the
mere crossing of ███████ in a ██████ drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or
the taking a long ████████ ████ on an empty ███████, in the negro heart
of Africa, which was the ███ of poor Mungo's performances--this kind of
travel, I say, may not be the very best ████ of █████████ a high social
██████. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
████████.

These ███████████ just here are ██████████ by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and I was █████████ to hear some
good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every
man ██████████ a ████████ ███████. And not only that, but they looked
███████████. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
█████████ ███████████ had ███████ great whales on the high seas--entire
█████████ to them--and ███████ them dead without ███████; and yet, here
they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same ███████, all of
███████ ██████--looking round as ██████████ at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some █████████ among the Green Mountains.
A curious sight; these ███████ bears, these █████ ███████ whalemen!

But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head of
the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an ██████. To be sure I cannot
say much for his breeding. His greatest ███████ could not have █████████
█████████ his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it
there without ████████; reaching over the table with it, to the ████████
████████ of many heads, and █████████ the ██████████ towards him. But
THAT was certainly very ██████ done by him, and every one knows that in
most people's ██████████, to do anything coolly is to do it █████████.

We will not speak of all Queequeg's █████████████ here; how he ████████
coffee and hot rolls, and ███████ his █████████ attention to beefsteaks,
done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he ████████ like the
rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting
there quietly █████████ and smoking with his ███████████ hat on, when I
███████ out for a ██████.



CHAPTER █. The Street.


If I had been ██████████ at first catching a ███████ of so outlandish
an ██████████ as Queequeg ███████████ among the polite society of a
civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.

In █████████████ nigh the docks, any considerable ███████ will
frequently offer to view the ████████ looking ████████████ from ███████
parts. Even in ████████ and ████████ streets, █████████████ mariners
will sometimes ██████ the ██████████ ██████. ██████ Street is not
unknown to ███████ and ██████; and at ██████, in the ██████ Green, live
███████ have often ██████ the ███████. But New Bedford █████ all Water
Street and ███████. In these last-█████████ haunts you see only sailors;
but in New Bedford, ██████ cannibals stand ████████ at street ███████;
savages ████████; many of whom yet carry on their bones ██████ █████. It
█████ a stranger █████.

But, besides the █████████, ██████████████, █████████████, ███████████,
and ███████████, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
which ████████ ████ about the streets, you will see other sights still
more curious, certainly more comical. There ██████ arrive in this town
scores of green ██████████ and New █████████ men, all athirst for ████
and glory in the fishery. They are ██████ young, of ████████ ██████;
███████ who have ██████ ███████, and now ████ to drop the ███ and ██████
the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains ██████ they
came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look
there! that chap █████████ round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and
swallow-██████ coat, ███████ with a sailor-████ and ██████-knife. Here
comes another with a ███'-██████ and a █████████ █████.

No town-bred █████ will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a
█████████ ███████ dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will ███ his
two acres in ████████ ██████ for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a █████████████
██████████, and █████ the great whale-fishery, you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In ██████████ his
sea-██████, he orders ████-███████ to his ██████████; ██████ to his
██████ trowsers. Ah, poor ███-Seed! how ████████ will █████ those straps
in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and
all, down the ██████ of the ███████.

But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
████████ to show her ████████. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that █████ of land would this
day perhaps have been in as howling █████████ as the coast of Labrador.
As it is, parts of her back country are enough to ████████ one, they
look so ████. The town itself is perhaps the ███████ place to live
in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like
██████; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with
████; nor in the spring-time do they ████ them with fresh ████. Yet, in
█████ of this, ███████ in all America will you find more █████████-like
houses; █████ and ███████ more ███████, than in New Bedford. Whence came
they? how ███████ upon this once ███████ ██████ of a country?

Go and ████ upon the iron ████████████ harpoons round yonder █████
███████, and your ████████ will be answered. Yes; all these █████ houses
and ███████ gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up ██████ from the bottom
of the sea. Can ████ █████████ ███████ a ████ like that?

In New Bedford, ███████, they say, give whales for ██████ to their
█████████, and portion off their ██████ with a few █████████ a-piece.
You must go to New Bedford to see a █████████ ███████; for, they say,
they have ██████████ of oil in every house, and every night ██████████
████ their ███████ in spermaceti candles.

In summer time, the town is █████ to see; full of fine ██████--long
avenues of green and ████. And in ██████, high in air, the █████████ and
█████████ horse-█████████, ██████████-████, ███████ the ██████-by their
████████ upright █████ of ███████████ ████████. So ██████████ is art;
which in many a district of New Bedford has ████████████ bright ████████
of ███████ upon the ██████ ██████ █████ thrown aside at creation's final
day.

And the █████ of New Bedford, they █████ like their own red █████. But
roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine █████████ of their cheeks
is █████████ as ████████ in the ███████ heavens. Elsewhere █████ that
bloom of ██████, ye cannot, save in █████, where they tell me the young
█████ ███████ such ████, their sailor ███████████ smell them miles off
shore, as though they were drawing nigh the ███████ Moluccas ███████ of
the █████████ █████.



CHAPTER █. The Chapel.


In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few are
the █████ fishermen, ███████ bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who
fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.

█████████ from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
special ██████. The ███ had changed from clear, █████ cold, to driving
█████ and ████. ████████ myself in my shaggy jacket of the █████ called
████████, I ██████ my way against the ████████ storm. Entering, I
found a small scattered ████████████ of sailors, and sailors' █████ and
██████. A muffled silence ███████, only broken at times by the ███████
of the storm. Each silent ██████████ seemed █████████ sitting █████ from
the other, as if each silent █████ were insular and ██████████████. The
████████ had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and
women sat ███████████ eyeing several ██████ ███████, with black ███████,
███████ into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran
something like the following, but I do not pretend to █████:--

SACRED TO THE ██████ OF JOHN ██████, Who, at the ███ of ████████, was
lost █████████, Near the ████ of ██████████, off █████████, November
███, ████. THIS ██████ Is ███████ to his Memory BY HIS ██████.

SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ██████ LONG, ██████ ██████, NATHAN ███████,
██████ █████, ████ MACY, AND SAMUEL █████, ███████ one of the boats'
crews OF THE SHIP █████ Who were █████ out of sight by a Whale, On the
Off-shore ██████ in the PACIFIC, December ████, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is
here placed by their █████████ SHIPMATES.

SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN ███████ █████, Who in the ████
of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of █████, AUGUST
██, ████. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS █████.

Shaking off the sleet from my ice-██████ hat and jacket, I seated myself
near the door, and turning ████████ was █████████ to see Queequeg near
me. ████████ by the █████████ of the scene, there was a █████████ gaze
of ███████████ curiosity in his ███████████. This savage was the only
person ███████ who seemed to ██████ my entrance; because he was the only
one who could not ████, and, therefore, was not ███████ those ██████
████████████ on the wall. Whether any of the █████████ of the seamen
whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;
but so many are the ██████████ █████████ in the fishery, and so plainly
did several women present ████ the countenance if not the █████████
of some █████████ grief, that I feel sure that here before me were
█████████ those, in whose █████████ hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets ███████████████ ██████ the old ██████ to █████ ██████.

Oh! ye whose dead lie ██████ beneath the green grass; who standing among
flowers can say--here, HERE lies my ███████; ye know not the desolation
that ██████ in ██████ like these. What bitter ██████ in those
black-████████ ███████ which cover no ashes! What ███████ in those
█████████ inscriptions! What ██████ █████ and ████████ ████████████ in
the lines that seem to ████ upon all █████, and refuse █████████████ to
the ██████ who have ███████████ ████████ without a █████. As well might
those tablets stand in the ████ of █████████ as here.

In what ██████ of living creatures, the dead of ███████ are ████████;
why it is that a universal ███████ says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more ███████ than the ███████ Sands; how it is
that to his name who █████████ departed for the other world, we ██████
so ███████████ and ███████ a word, and yet do not thus ███████ him, if
he but ███████ for the remotest ██████ of this living earth; why the
Life █████████ █████████ pay death-███████████ upon █████████; in what
███████, ██████████ █████████, and deadly, hopeless ██████, yet lies
███████ ████ who ████ sixty round █████████ ago; how it is that we
still refuse to be █████████ for those who we nevertheless ████████ are
████████ in ███████████ █████; why all the living so ██████ to ████ all
the dead; wherefore but the █████ of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
whole city. All these things are not without their ████████.

But Faith, like a ██████, █████ among the █████, and even from these
dead ██████ she ███████ her most █████ hope.

It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the ███ of a
Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the █████
light of that ████████, ███████ day read the ████ of the whalemen
who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be █████. But
somehow I ████ █████ again. ██████████ inducements to embark, fine
chance for █████████, it seems--███, a stove boat will make me an
████████ by ██████. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a
████████████ quick ███████ ████████ of a man into ████████. But what
then? ████████ we have ██████ ████████ this matter of Life and Death.
Methinks that what they call my ██████ here on earth is my true
█████████. Methinks that in looking at things █████████, we are too
much like ███████ observing the sun through the water, and thinking that
thick water the ████████ of air. Methinks my body is but the ████ of my
better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not
me. And therefore three ██████ for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and
stove body when they will, for █████ my soul, Jove himself cannot.



CHAPTER █. The Pulpit.


I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain █████████
██████████ entered; immediately as the storm-██████ door flew back upon
█████████ him, a quick █████████ eyeing of him by all the congregation,
████████████ ████████ that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
was the famous ██████ ██████, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
█████, but for many years past had █████████ his life to the ████████.
At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems ███████ into a second
█████████ youth, for among all the ████████ of his ████████, there shone
certain mild ██████ of a newly ██████████ bloom--the spring ███████
███████ forth even beneath ████████'s snow. No one having previously
heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without
the ██████ interest, because there were certain █████████ ████████
peculiarities about him, █████████ to that adventurous ████████ life
he had led. When he entered I observed that he ███████ no ████████, and
certainly had not come in his ████████, for his █████████ hat ran down
with ███████ sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had ████████.
However, hat and coat and █████████ were one by one ███████, and hung up
in a little space in an ████████ corner; when, ███████ in a decent suit,
he quietly ██████████ the pulpit.

Like most old fashioned ███████, it was a very lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
█████████ ████████ the already small ████ of the chapel, the █████████,
it seemed, had █████ upon the ████ of Father Mapple, and finished the
pulpit without a stairs, ████████████ a perpendicular side ██████, like
those used in ████████ a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling
captain had ████████ the chapel with a ████████ pair of red ███████
man-█████ for this ladder, which, being itself ██████ ██████, and
stained with a ████████ colour, the whole ███████████, considering what
manner of chapel it was, seemed by no █████ in bad █████. Halting for
an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands ████████ the
██████████ █████ of the man-ropes, Father Mapple ████ a look ███████,
and then with a truly sailor-like but still ███████████ █████████, hand
over hand, mounted the steps as if █████████ the main-top of his vessel.

The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is ███████ the case with
swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the ██████ were of wood,
so that at every ████ there was a █████. At my first glimpse of the
pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
these ██████ in the present instance seemed ███████████. For I was not
prepared to see Father Mapple after ███████ the height, slowly turn
round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step, till the whole was █████████ within, leaving him
███████████ in his little ██████.

I pondered some time without █████ █████████████ the reason for this.
Father Mapple ███████ such a wide reputation for █████████ and ████████,
that I could not suspect him of ████████ █████████ by any mere ██████
of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this
thing; ███████████, it must █████████ something ██████. Can it be,
then, that by that act of physical █████████, he █████████ his spiritual
██████████ for the time, from all ███████ ███████ ████ and ██████████?
Yes, for ███████████ with the meat and wine of the word, to the ████████
man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing ██████████--a lofty
███████████████, with a perennial well of water within the walls.

But the side ladder was not the only strange ███████ of the place,
████████ from the chaplain's former sea-███████. Between the marble
█████████ on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
was ███████ with a large painting representing a ███████ ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and █████
████████. But high above the flying ████ and dark-rolling clouds, there
floated a little isle of sunlight, from which ██████ forth an angel's
face; and this bright face ████ a ████████ spot of ████████ upon the
ship's tossed deck, something like that silver █████ now ████████ into
the ███████'s plank where ██████ fell. "Ah, noble ship," the angel
seemed to say, "████ on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
████; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
off--████████ █████ is at hand."

Nor was the pulpit itself without a █████ of the same sea-taste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its ████████ front was in
the ████████ of a ship's █████ bows, and the Holy █████ ██████ on a
projecting piece of ██████ work, fashioned after a ship's ██████-headed
████.

What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth's
████████ part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit █████ the
world. From thence it is the storm of God's quick █████ is first
████████, and the bow must bear the ████████ █████. From thence it is
the God of breezes fair or foul is first ███████ for ██████████ winds.
Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage ████████;
and the pulpit is its ████.



CHAPTER █. The ██████.


Father Mapple ████, and in a mild voice of ██████████ █████████ ███████
the scattered people to ████████. "█████████ ███████, there! side away
to ████████--larboard gangway to starboard! ████████! midships!"

There was a low ████████ of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
still ████████ █████████ of women's █████, and all was quiet again, and
every eye on the preacher.

He ██████ a little; then ████████ in the pulpit's bows, ██████ his large
brown hands ██████ his chest, ████████ his ██████ eyes, and ███████
a ██████ so deeply ██████ that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
bottom of the sea.

This ended, in █████████ ██████ █████, like the █████████ ███████ of
a bell in a ship that is ██████████ at sea in a ███--in such tones he
commenced reading the following ████; but ████████ his manner towards
the concluding ███████, burst forth with a ███████ ██████████ and joy--

     "The ribs and ███████ in the whale,
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
     While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
     And ████ me █████████ down to doom.

     "I saw the opening ███ of hell,
     With endless pains and ███████ there;
     Which none but they that feel can tell--
     Oh, I was ████████ to despair.

     "In black ████████, I called my God,
     When I could scarce believe him mine,
     He █████ his ███ to my ██████████--
     No more the whale did me ███████.

     "With █████ he flew to my ██████,
     As on a ███████ ███████ █████;
     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
     The face of my █████████ God.

     "My song for ever shall ██████
     That terrible, that ██████ hour;
     I give the glory to my God,
     His all the █████ and the █████."


Nearly all ██████ in singing this hymn, which ███████ high above the
howling of the storm. A brief █████ ██████; the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
the proper ████, said: "Beloved shipmates, ██████ the last █████ of the
first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
Jonah.'"

"Shipmates, this book, containing only four ████████--four █████--is one
of the ████████ ███████ in the mighty █████ of the ██████████. Yet what
██████ of the soul does Jonah's deep ███████ sound! what a ████████
██████ to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that ████████ in the
fish's belly! How ██████-like and ████████████ grand! We feel the ██████
███████ over us; we sound with him to the █████ bottom of the ██████;
sea-████ and all the █████ of the sea is about us! But WHAT is this
lesson that the book of Jonah ███████? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded
lesson; a lesson to us all as ██████ men, and a lesson to me as a pilot
of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it
is a story of the ███, hard-███████████, suddenly ████████ fears, the
swift ██████████, ██████████, ███████, and finally the ███████████ and
joy of Jonah. As with all ███████ among men, the sin of this ███ of
███████ was in his ██████ ████████████ of the ███████ of God--never
mind now what that command was, or how ████████--which he found a hard
command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to
do--remember that--and █████, he ███████ ████████ us than █████████ to
████████. And if we obey God, we must ███████ ourselves; and it is in
this ██████████ ourselves, ███████ the ████████ of ███████ God ████████.

"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further ██████ at
God, by ███████ to ████ from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will
carry him into █████████ where God does not █████, but only the Captains
of this earth. He ██████ about the wharves of █████, and █████ a ship
that's bound for ████████. There █████, perhaps, a ████████ unheeded
meaning here. By all ████████ Tarshish could have been no other city
than the modern █████. That's the ███████ of learned men. And where is
Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,
as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the
Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern █████,
shipmates, is on the most ████████ coast of the Mediterranean, the
██████; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
████████ from that, just outside the ███████ of █████████. See ye
not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and ██████ of all █████; with
████████ hat and guilty eye, ████████ from his God; ████████ among the
████████ like a vile ███████ █████████ to █████ the seas. So ██████████,
self-condemning is his look, that had there been █████████ in those
days, Jonah, on the mere █████████ of something █████, had been ████████
ere he ███████ a deck. How plainly he's a ████████! no ███████, not a
hat-box, ██████, or carpet-bag,--no friends █████████ him to the █████
with their ██████. At last, after much ███████ ██████, he █████ the
Tarshish ship receiving the last █████ of her █████; and as he steps on
board to see its Captain in the █████, all the sailors for the moment
██████ from ████████ in the █████, to mark the stranger's ████ eye.
Jonah ████ this; but in vain he █████ to look all ease and ██████████;
in vain ██████ his wretched █████. Strong ██████████ of the man assure
the mariners he can be no ████████. In their ████████ but still serious
way, one ████████ to the other--"Jack, he's ██████ a widow;" or, "███,
do you mark him; he's a ████████;" or, "█████ ███, I guess he's the
█████████ that broke ████ in old Gomorrah, or ██████, one of the ███████
█████████ from █████." Another ████ to read the bill that's stuck
against the █████ upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering
five hundred gold █████ for the ████████████ of a █████████, and
containing a description of his person. He █████, and looks from Jonah
to the bill; while all his ███████████ shipmates now █████ round Jonah,
prepared to lay their hands upon him. ████████ Jonah ████████, and
█████████ all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a
coward. He will not confess himself █████████; but that itself is strong
suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him
not to be the man that is ██████████, they let him ████, and he ████████
into the cabin.

"'Who's there?' █████ the Captain at his ████ ████, █████████ making
out his papers for the ███████--'Who's there?' Oh! how that ████████
question ███████ Jonah! For the instant he almost █████ to flee again.
But he ███████. 'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon
sail ye, sir?' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,
though the man now stands before him; but no ██████ does he hear that
hollow voice, than he █████ a ████████████ ██████. 'We sail with the
next coming ████,' at last he slowly answered, still ████████ eyeing
him. 'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger.' Ha! Jonah, that's another ████. But he ███████ █████ away
the Captain from that █████. 'I'll sail with ye,'--he says,--'the
passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.' For it is particularly
███████, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be ██████████ in this
history, 'that he paid the fare ███████' ere the craft did sail. And
taken with the ███████, this is full of meaning.

"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose ███████████ ███████ █████
in any, but whose ████████ ███████ it only in the █████████. In this
world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel ██████, and without
a ████████; whereas Virtue, if a ██████, is stopped at all █████████.
So Jonah's Captain ████████ to ████ the length of Jonah's purse, ere he
█████ him ██████. He ███████ him ██████ the █████ sum; and it's ████████
to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same
time ████████ to help a ██████ that █████ its rear with gold. Yet when
Jonah fairly takes out his purse, ███████ ██████████ still ██████ the
Captain. He █████ every ████ to find a ███████████. Not a ██████, any
way, he ███████; and Jonah is put down for his passage. 'Point out my
state-room, Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary; I ████ sleep.'
'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain, 'there's ███ room.' Jonah
██████, and would lock the door, but the lock ████████ no key. Hearing
him █████████ fumbling there, the Captain ██████ lowly to himself, and
mutters something about the doors of ████████' █████ being never ███████
to be ██████ within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws
himself into his █████, and finds the little state-room ███████ almost
███████ on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah █████. Then, in
that ██████████ hole, ████, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah
█████ the █████████ ████████████ of that ████████ hour, when the whale
shall hold him in the smallest of his ██████' █████.

"Screwed at its ████ against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
██████████ in Jonah's room; and the ship, ███████ over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last █████ received, the lamp, flame and all,
though in slight motion, still █████████ a █████████ █████████ with
reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it
but made ███████ the █████, lying ██████ among which it hung. The lamp
██████ and █████████ Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
roll round the place, and this thus far ██████████ fugitive finds no
██████ for his restless glance. But that █████████████ in the lamp more
and more ██████ him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all ████.
'Oh! so my ██████████ █████ in me!' he ██████, 'straight upwards, so it
█████; but the ████████ of my soul are all in ███████████!'

"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry ████ to his bed, still
███████, but with conscience yet ████████ him, as the █████████ of the
█████ ████-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in █████ ███████,
praying God for ████████████ █████ the ███ be passed; and at last ████
the █████ of ███ he feels, a deep ██████ ██████ over him, as over the
man who ██████ to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught
to ███████ it; so, after sore ██████████ in his berth, Jonah's ███████
of ponderous ██████ █████ him ████████ down to sleep.

"And now the time of tide has come; the ship █████ off her ██████; and
from the deserted wharf the █████████ ship for Tarshish, all █████████,
██████ to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of ████████
█████████! the ██████████ was Jonah. But the sea ██████; he will not
bear the ██████ ██████. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
break. But now when the █████████ calls all hands to ███████ her;
when █████, bales, and ████ are ██████████ overboard; when the wind
is █████████, and the men are ███████, and every plank ████████ with
█████████ feet right over Jonah's head; in all this ██████ ██████, Jonah
sleeps his ███████ sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not
the reeling ███████, and little hears he or █████ he the far ████ of the
mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is ████████ the seas after
him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--a
berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was ████ ██████. But the
██████████ master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, 'What
███████ thou, O, ███████! █████!' ████████ from his ████████ by that
direful cry, Jonah ████████ to his feet, and █████████ to the deck,
██████ a ██████, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is
██████ upon by a ███████ billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after
wave thus █████ into the ship, and ███████ no ██████ ████ runs roaring
fore and ███, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet ██████.
And ever, as the white ████ █████ her affrighted face from the █████
███████ in the blackness ████████, ██████ Jonah sees the ███████
bowsprit pointing high ██████, but soon beat ████████ again towards the
tormented deep.

"Terrors upon terrors run ████████ through his soul. In all his ████████
█████████, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
fully to test the truth, by █████████ the whole matter to high Heaven,
they ████ to ███████ ████, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that ██████████, then how furiously they
███ him with their █████████. 'What is thine ██████████? Whence ██████
thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the ████████
of poor Jonah. The █████ mariners but ███ him who he is, and where
from; whereas, they not only ███████ an answer to those questions,
but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the
███████████ answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is
upon him.

"'I am a ██████,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
who ████ made the sea and the dry land!' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
████████ thou fear the Lord God THEN! ███████████, he now goes on to
make a full ██████████; █████████ the mariners became more and more
████████, but still are ███████. For when Jonah, not yet ████████████
God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
███████,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest
was upon them; they ██████████ turn from him, and seek by other means to
save the ship. But all in vain; the █████████ gale █████ ██████;
then, with one hand raised ██████████ to God, with the other they not
█████████████ lay hold of Jonah.

"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and ███████ into the sea;
when instantly an ████ ████████ ██████ out from the east, and the sea
is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving ██████
water behind. He goes down in the ████████ heart of such a ██████████
█████████ that he scarce heeds the moment when he █████ ████████ into
the ███████ jaws ████████ him; and the whale ██████-to all his ivory
teeth, like so many white █████, upon his ██████. Then Jonah ██████ ████
the Lord out of the fish's belly. But ███████ his prayer, and █████ a
███████ lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not ████ and ████ for
██████ deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He
leaves all his deliverance to God, ██████████ himself with this, that
spite of all his pains and █████, he will still look towards His holy
██████. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not
█████████ for ██████, but ████████ for punishment. And how ████████ to
God was this ███████ in Jonah, is █████ in the ████████ deliverance of
him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before
you to be ██████ for his sin but I do place him before you as a █████
for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take ████ to ██████ of it like
Jonah."

While he was ████████ these words, the howling of the shrieking,
████████ storm without seemed to ███ new power to the preacher, who,
when ██████████ Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
His deep chest ██████ as with a ground-█████; his tossed arms seemed the
███████ elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his
███████ ████, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple
███████ look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.

There now came a ████ in his look, as he ████████ turned over the leaves
of the Book once more; and, at last, standing ██████████, with closed
eyes, for the moment, seemed █████████ with God and himself.

But again he ██████ over towards the people, and ██████ his head lowly,
with an ██████ of the deepest yet ████████ ████████, he █████ these
words:

"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands █████
upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me,
for I am a ███████ ██████ than ye. And now how ██████ would I come down
from this mast-head and sit on the ███████ there where you sit, and
██████ as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more
awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God.
How being an ████████ pilot-prophet, or ███████ of true things, and
██████ by the Lord to sound those █████████ ██████ in the ears of a
wicked ███████, Jonah, appalled at the █████████ he should raise, ████
from his ███████, and sought to ██████ his duty and his God by taking
ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never ███████. As we
have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to
living █████ of doom, and with swift █████████ tore him along 'into the
midst of the seas,' where the ███████ depths ██████ him ten thousand
███████ down, and 'the █████ were wrapped about his head,' and all the
watery world of woe ██████ over him. Yet even then beyond the █████ of
any ███████--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon
the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the █████████, █████████
prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the
shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came █████████
up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the ████████ of air and
earth; and '███████ out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the
Lord came a second time; and Jonah, ███████ and ██████--his ears, like
two sea-██████, still ███████████████ █████████ of the ocean--Jonah
did the Almighty's ███████. And what was that, shipmates? To ██████ the
Truth to the face of █████████! That was it!

"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
the living God who ███████ it. Woe to him whom this world ██████ from
Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to ████ oil upon the waters when God
has ██████ them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than
to █████! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe
to him who, in this world, ██████ not █████████! Woe to him who would
not be true, even though to be false were █████████! Yea, woe to him
who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while █████████ to others is
himself a ████████!"

He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then ███████ his
face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
a ████████ ██████████,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
every woe, there is a sure ███████; and higher the top of that delight,
than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-█████ higher than
the ██████ is low? Delight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward
delight--who against the █████ gods and ██████████ of this earth, ever
stands forth his own ██████████ self. Delight is to him whose strong
arms yet ███████ him, when the ship of this ████ ███████████ world has
gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who █████ no quarter in the
truth, and █████, burns, and ████████ all sin though he █████ it out
from under the █████ of ████████ and ██████. Delight,--top-gallant
delight is to him, who ████████████ no law or lord, but the Lord his
God, and is only a ███████ to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the
waves of the ███████ of the seas of the boisterous mob can never █████
from this sure ████ of the Ages. And eternal delight and █████████████
will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
breath--O Father!--███████ known to me by Thy ███--mortal or immortal,
here I ███. I have ███████ to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or
mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man
that he should live out the ████████ of his God?"

He said no more, but slowly ██████ a ███████████, covered his face with
his hands, and so ████████ kneeling, till all the people had departed,
and he was left alone in the place.



CHAPTER 10. A █████ ██████.


Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time.
He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove
██████, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
negro idol of his; ███████ hard into its face, and with a jack-knife
██████ whittling away at its ████, meanwhile ███████ to himself in his
heathenish way.

But being now ███████████, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his ███
began ████████ the █████ with deliberate ██████████; at every ████████
page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking ████████ around him, and
giving █████████ to a long-drawn ████████ ███████ of astonishment. He
would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to ████████ at number
one each time, as though he could not █████ more than fifty, and it was
only by such a large number of ███████ being found together, that his
astonishment at the █████████ of pages was excited.

With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and
█████████ ██████ about the face--at least to my taste--his countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means ████████████. You cannot
████ the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw
the ██████ of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
fiery black and bold, there seemed ██████ of a ██████ that would ████ a
thousand ██████. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty ███████
about the Pagan, which even his ███████████ could not altogether ████.
He looked like a man who had never ███████ and never had had a ████████.
Whether it was, too, that his head being ██████, his forehead was drawn
out in █████ and ████████ relief, and looked more █████████ than it
otherwise would, this I will not venture to ██████; but certain it was
his head was ███████████████ an █████████ one. It may seem ██████████,
but it reminded me of General ██████████'s head, as seen in the ███████
█████ of him. It had the same long █████████ ██████ ██████████ slope
from above the █████, which were likewise very projecting, like two
long ████████████ thickly ██████ on top. Queequeg was ██████ Washington
█████████████████ █████████.

██████ I was thus closely scanning him, half-██████████ meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the ████████, he never ██████ my ████████,
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared
██████ ████████ with counting the pages of the marvellous book.
Considering how ████████ we had been sleeping together the night
previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this ████████████
of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not
know exactly how to take them. At first they are █████████; their calm
self-█████████████ of ██████████ seems a ████████ wisdom. I had noticed
also that Queequeg never █████████ at all, or but very little, with the
other seamen in the inn. He made no ████████ whatever; appeared to have
no ██████ to ███████ the ██████ of his █████████████. All this struck
me as mighty ████████; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something
almost ███████ in it. Here was a man some ██████ thousand miles from
home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could
get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
the ██████ ███████; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; ██████████
the utmost ████████; content with his own █████████████; always equal to
himself. Surely this was a touch of fine ██████████; though no doubt he
had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be
true ████████████, we ███████ should not be conscious of so living or
so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself
out for a ███████████, I conclude that, like the █████████ old █████, he
must have "broken his ████████."

As I sat there in that now ██████ room; the fire ███████ low, in that
mild stage when, after its first █████████ has ██████ the air, it then
only █████ to be looked at; the evening shades and ████████ gathering
round the █████████, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain;
the storm ███████ without in solemn ██████; I began to be ████████ of
strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
and ████████ hand were turned against the ███████ world. This ████████
savage had ████████ it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there ██████ no civilized ███████████ and █████ ███████.
Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself
████████████ drawn towards him. And those same things that would have
████████ most others, they were the very ███████ that thus drew me. I'll
try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian ████████ has proved but
hollow ████████. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs
and █████, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little
noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last
night's █████████████, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows. I told him yes; ███████ I thought he looked pleased, perhaps
a little ████████████.

We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the ████████, and the meaning of the few ████████
that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went
to █████████ the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
in this famous town. Soon I ████████ a social smoke; and, █████████
his █████ and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a ████. And then we sat
██████████ █████ from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly
passing between us.

If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's
breast, this pleasant, ██████ smoke we had, soon ██████ it out, and left
us ███████. He seemed to take to me quite as █████████ and ██████████ as
I to him; and when our smoke was over, he ███████ his forehead against
mine, ███████ me round the █████, and said that ██████████ we were
███████; meaning, in his country's ██████, that we were bosom friends;
he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a ██████████, this
sudden flame of ██████████ would have seemed far too █████████, a thing
to be much ██████████; but in this simple savage those old █████ would
not █████.

After supper, and another social ████ and smoke, we went to our room
together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
enormous tobacco wallet, and ███████ under the tobacco, drew out
some thirty ███████ in silver; then █████████ them on the table, and
████████████ ████████ them into two equal ████████, pushed one of them
towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to ███████████; but he
████████ me by ███████ them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them ████.
He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
the █████ fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed
anxious for me to ████ him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
███████████ a moment whether, in case he ███████ me, I would ██████ or
otherwise.

I was a good Christian; ████ and bred in the bosom of the ██████████
████████████ Church. How then could I unite with this wild ████████ in
███████████ his piece of wood? But what is ███████? thought I. Do
you suppose now, Ishmael, that the ███████████ God of heaven and
earth--██████ and all included--can possibly be ███████ of an
█████████████ bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?--to do
the will of God--THAT is worship. And what is the will of God?--to do to
my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me--THAT is the
will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that
this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
Presbyterian form of worship. ████████████, I must then unite with him
in his; ████, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped
████ up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
Queequeg; ███████ before him twice or thrice; ██████ his nose; and that
done, we undressed and went to bed, at █████ with our own ███████████
and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
███████████ between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very
bottom of their █████ to each other; and some old ███████ often lie
and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts'
█████████, lay I and Queequeg--a ████, loving pair.



CHAPTER ██. █████████.


We had ████ thus in bed, chatting and ███████ at short █████████, and
Queequeg now and then ██████████████ throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely ████████ and free
and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our ██████████████, what
little ███████████ remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the ██████.

Yes, we became very ███████; so much so that our █████████ ████████
began to grow █████████, and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
head-board with our four █████ drawn up close together, and our two
█████ ███████ over them, as if our ████████ were ███████-████. We felt
very nice and snug, the more so since it was so ██████ out of doors;
indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy ██████ ██████, some
small part of you must be cold, for there is no ███████ in this world
that is not what it is ██████ by contrast. Nothing ██████ in itself. If
you ███████ yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so
a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if,
like Queequeg and me in the bed, the ███ of your nose or the █████
of your head be slightly ███████, why then, indeed, in the general
consciousness you feel most ████████████ and ████████████ warm. For this
reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which
is one of the █████████ ███████████ of the ████. For the height of this
sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your ████████ and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the
one warm █████ in the heart of an arctic ███████.

We had been sitting in this █████████ manner for some time, when all at
once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
keeping my eyes ████, in order the more to ███████████ the snugness
of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own ████████ ██████
██████ his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element
of our ████████, though light be more █████████ to our ██████ part. Upon
opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created
darkness into the ███████ and ██████ outer gloom of the █████████████
twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable █████████. Nor did
I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt
a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,
that though I had felt such a strong ██████████ to his smoking in the
bed the night before, yet see how ███████ our stiff prejudices grow when
love once comes to ████ them. For now I liked nothing better than to
have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full
of such ██████ █████████ joy then. I no more felt ██████ concerned for
the landlord's ██████ of insurance. I was only alive to the █████████
confidential ███████████████ of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed
the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a
blue ███████ ██████ of smoke, ███████████ by the flame of the new-lit
lamp.

Whether it was that this ██████████ tester rolled the savage away to far
distant ██████, I know not, but he now spoke of his ██████ island; and,
eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly
complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his
words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more ████████ with
his broken ███████████, now enable me to present the whole story such as
it may █████ in the mere ████████ I give.



CHAPTER ██. ████████████.


Queequeg was a native of ████████, an island far away to the West and
South. It is not down in any ███; true places never are.

When a new-███████ savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass █████, followed by the ████████ █████, as if he were a green
███████; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire
to see something more of ███████████ than a ████████ ██████ or two. His
father was a High Chief, a King; his █████ a High ██████; and on the
████████ side he ███████ █████ who were the wives of █████████████
████████. There was excellent blood in his █████--royal stuff; though
sadly ████████, I fear, by the cannibal ██████████ he █████████ in his
█████████ youth.

A ███ ██████ ship visited his father's ███, and Queequeg sought a
passage to Christian █████. But the ship, having her full ██████████ of
seamen, ███████ his suit; and not all the King his father's █████████
could ███████. But Queequeg █████ a ███. Alone in his █████, he ███████
off to a distant ██████, which he knew the ship must pass through when
she ███████ the island. On one side was a coral ████; on the other a low
tongue of land, covered with ████████ ████████ that grew out into the
water. ██████ his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its
prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, ██████ low in hand; and when the
ship was ███████ by, like a █████ he darted out; ██████ her side; with
one backward ████ of his foot ████████ and ████ his canoe; ███████ up
the ██████; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, ████████
a ████-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though ██████ in pieces.

In vain the captain ██████████ to throw him overboard; █████████ a
███████ over his █████ ██████; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
Queequeg ██████ not. Struck by his █████████ █████████████, and his wild
desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last ████████, and told
him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage--this sea
██████ of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put him down among
the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to
████ in the █████████ of foreign ██████, Queequeg █████████ no seeming
████████, if thereby he might ███████ gain the power of ████████████ his
untutored ██████████. For at bottom--so he told me--he was ████████ by a
profound desire to learn among the ██████████, the ████ whereby to
make his people still ███████ than they were; and more than that,
still better than they were. But, alas! the █████████ of whalemen soon
convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked;
██████████ more so, than all his father's ████████. Arrived at last in
old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on
to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their █████ in that place also,
poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in
all meridians; I'll die a pagan.

And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet █████ among these Christians,
████ their clothes, and tried to talk their █████████. Hence the queer
ways about him, though now some time from home.

By hints, I █████ him whether he did not ███████ going back, and having
a ██████████; since he might now ████████ his father dead and gone, he
being very old and ██████ at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet;
and added that he was ███████ ████████████, or rather Christians, had
████████ him for ascending the pure and █████████ ██████ of thirty pagan
Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as
he felt himself ████████ again. For the █████, however, he proposed to
sail about, and ███ his wild ████ in all four oceans. They had made a
harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a ███████ now.

I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
█████████. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old ████████. Upon
this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
█████████ to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most █████████ port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany
me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,
the same boat, the same ████ with me, in short to █████ my every ███;
with both my hands in his, ██████ ███ into the ███████ of both ██████.
To all this I ████████ assented; for besides the █████████ I now felt
for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not
fail to be of great ██████████ to one, who, like me, was wholly ████████
of the █████████ of whaling, though well ██████████ with the sea, as
known to merchant seamen.

His story being ended with his pipe's last █████ puff, Queequeg ████████
me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we
rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were
sleeping.


CHAPTER 13. ███████████.


Next morning, Monday, after █████████ of the embalmed head to a ██████,
for a █████, I ███████ my own and comrade's bill; using, however, my
comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's ████ and ████ stories
about him had previously so much ███████ me concerning the very person
whom I now █████████ with.

We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and █████████ our things, including my own
poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas ████ and hammock, away we went
down to "the ████," the little Nantucket packet ████████ moored at the
wharf. As we were going along the people ██████; not at Queequeg
so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
heeded them not, going along ████████ the ██████ by turns, and Queequeg
now and then stopping to ██████ the sheath on his harpoon █████. I asked
him why he carried such a ███████████ thing with him ashore, and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in
substance, he replied, that though what I ██████ was true enough, yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
███████ stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales. In short, like many ██████ ███████
and ██████, who go into the ███████' ███████ armed with their own
███████--though in no wise ███████ to ███████ them--even so, Queequeg,
for his own private ███████, █████████ his own harpoon.

████████ the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The ██████
of his ship, it seems, had ████ him one, in which to carry his
heavy chest to his ████████ house. Not to seem ignorant about the
thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrow--Queequeg ████ his chest upon it; ██████ it
fast; and then shoulders the barrow and ███████ up the wharf. "Why,"
said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
think. Didn't the people laugh?"

Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of
Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding ██████ express the ████████ water
of young █████████ into a large stained ████████ like a █████████; and
this punchbowl always █████ the great central ████████ on the ███████
mat where the █████ is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at Rokovoko, and its █████████--from all accounts, a very
███████ ███████████ █████████, at least for a sea captain--this
commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a
pretty young ████████ just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding
██████ were assembled at the █████'s ██████ cottage, this Captain
marches in, and being ████████ the ████ of honour, placed himself over
against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his ███████ the
King, Queequeg's father. █████ being said,--for those people have their
grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that ██████ us, who at such
times look downwards to our ████████, they, on the contrary, ███████ the
█████, glance upwards to the great █████ of all feasts--Grace, I say,
being said, the High Priest █████ the ███████ by the ██████████ ceremony
of the island; that is, ███████ his ███████████ and ████████████ fingers
into the ████ before the blessed ████████ ██████████. Seeing himself
placed next the Priest, and ██████ the ceremony, and thinking
himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain ██████████ over a
mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain coolly
████████ to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a
huge ██████-glass. "Now," said Queequeg, "what you ████ now?--Didn't our
people laugh?"

At last, passage paid, and ███████ safe, we stood on board the schooner.
Hoisting sail, it glided down the ████████ river. On one side, New
Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all
glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge █████ and mountains of █████ on
casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-█████████
whale ships lay silent and ██████ moored at last; while from others
came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of █████ and
██████ to ████ the pitch, all ██████████ that new ███████ were on the
█████; that one most ████████ and long voyage ended, only begins a
second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever
and for aye. Such is the ███████████, yea, the ███████████████ of all
earthly ██████.

Gaining the more open water, the ███████ ██████ █████ fresh; the little
Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his █████████.
How I ███████ that ██████ air!--how I spurned that ████████ earth!--that
common ███████ all over dented with the █████ of ███████ █████ and
█████; and turned me to ██████ the ███████████ of the sea which will
██████ no ███████.

At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to █████ and reel with me.
His dusky ████████ swelled apart; he showed his █████ and ███████ teeth.
On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did ██████ to the
█████; ██████ and dived her bows as a slave before the ██████. Sideways
leaning, we sideways darted; every ████████ ████████ like a ████; the
two tall masts ████████ like Indian █████ in land █████████. So full of
this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that
for some time we did not notice the ███████ ███████ of the passengers, a
██████-like ████████, who █████████ that two fellow beings should be so
█████████████; as though a white man were anything more █████████ than a
███████████ negro. But there were some ███████ and bumpkins there, who,
by their ███████ █████████, must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young ████████ █████████ him
behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping
his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
██████████ dexterity and ████████, ████ him high up bodily into the air;
then slightly tapping his stern in mid-████████, the fellow landed with
████████ lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him,
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.

"███████! Capting!" ██████ the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
"Capting, Capting, here's the devil."

"█████, █████ sir," cried the Captain, a █████ ███ of the sea, ████████
up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you
might have killed that chap?"

"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there," pointing
to the still █████████ █████████.

"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, ████████ his tattooed face into an unearthly
██████████ of ███████, "ah! him ████ small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e
so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"

"Look you," ██████ the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you
try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."

But it so ████████ just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
mind his own eye. The prodigious ██████ upon the main-sail had ██████
the weather-sheet, and the tremendous ████ was now flying from side to
side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor
fellow whom Queequeg had ███████ so ███████, was █████ overboard; all
hands were in a █████; and to attempt █████████ at the boom to stay it,
seemed ███████. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost
in one ███████ of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
████████ into █████████. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed ███████ of
being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the
boom as if it were the █████ jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
midst of this █████████████, Queequeg dropped ██████ to his knees, and
████████ under the path of the boom, ███████ hold of a rope, ███████ one
end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a █████, caught it
round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next ████, the spar
was that way ███████, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the
wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,
████████ to the waist, darted from the side with a long living ███ of
a ████. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,
throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns █████████
his brawny shoulders through the ████████ foam. I looked at the grand
and ████████ fellow, but saw no one to be █████. The greenhorn had gone
down. ████████ himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now
took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how ███████
were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,
one arm still striking out, and with the other ████████ a ████████ form.
The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was ████████. All hands
█████ Queequeg a noble █████; the captain begged his pardon. From that
hour I █████ to Queequeg like a ████████; yea, till poor Queequeg took
his last long dive.

Was there ever such ███████████████? He did not seem to think that he at
all ████████ a █████ from the ██████ and Magnanimous █████████. He only
asked for water--fresh water--something to ████ the █████ off; that
done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying
to himself--"It's a ██████, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
cannibals must help these Christians."



CHAPTER ██. Nantucket.


Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the ██████████; so, after a
fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
the world it ████████; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
than the █████████ ██████████. Look at it--a mere ███████, and █████ of
sand; all beach, without a ██████████. There is more sand there than
you would ███ in twenty years as a substitute for ████████ paper. Some
gamesome ██████ will tell you that they have to █████ weeds there, they
don't grow naturally; that they ██████ ██████ ████████; that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a ████ in an oil ████; that
pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like ████ of the true
cross in ████; that people there plant ██████████ before their houses,
to get under the shade in summer time; that one █████ of grass makes an
█████, three blades in a day's walk a ███████; that they wear █████████
shoes, something like █████████ snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
belted about, every way ████████, ██████████, and made an █████ island
of by the ocean, that to their very ██████ and ██████ small █████ will
sometimes be found ████████, as to the █████ of sea ███████. But these
█████████████ only show that Nantucket is no ████████.

Look now at the ████████ ███████████ story of how this island was
settled by the red-men. Thus goes the ██████. In █████ times an █████
███████ down upon the New England coast, and carried off an ██████
Indian in his ██████. With loud ██████ the ███████ saw their child borne
out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same
█████████. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they
discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory ██████,--the
poor little Indian's skeleton.

What wonder, then, that these ████████████, born on a beach, should take
to the sea for a ██████████! They first caught █████ and ███████ in
the sand; █████ ██████, they █████ out with ████ for ████████; more
experienced, they pushed off in boats and ████████ ███; and at last,
█████████ a ████ of great ships on the sea, ████████ this watery world;
put an incessant belt of █████████████████ round it; ██████ in
at ███████'s Straits; and in all ███████ and all oceans ████████
everlasting war with the █████████ ████████ mass that has ████████ the
flood; most monstrous and most ███████████! That ██████████, salt-sea
████████, ███████ with such ██████████████ of ███████████ power, that
his very ██████ are more to be ███████ than his most ████████ and
█████████ ████████!

And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea ███████, ███████ from
their ███-hill in the sea, ███████ and █████████ the watery world like
so many ██████████; ██████████ out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans, as the three ██████ ██████ did ██████. Let America add
██████ to █████, and ████ ████ upon Canada; let the English █████████
all India, and hang out their ███████ ██████ from the sun; two ██████
of this ███████████ globe are the ███████████'s. For the sea is his; he
████ it, as ████████ own ███████; other seamen having but a right of
way through it. Merchant ships are but █████████ ███████; armed ones but
floating █████; even pirates and ██████████, though following the sea
as ██████████ the ████, they but ███████ other ships, other █████████ of
the land like themselves, without seeking to ████ their living from the
bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone ███████ and █████ on
the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and
███ █████████ it as his own special ██████████. THERE is his home; THERE
lies his business, which a ████'s flood would not █████████, though it
███████████ all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie
█████ in the prairie; he █████ among the waves, he ██████ them as
███████ ███████ climb the ████. For years he knows not the land; so
that when he comes to it at last, it ██████ like another world, more
█████████ than the moon would to an █████████. With the ████████ ████,
that at sunset █████ her █████ and is rocked to sleep between billows;
so at █████████, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, █████ his █████,
and ████ him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush █████ of
████████ and whales.



CHAPTER ██. ███████.


It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came ██████
to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of
the Spouter-Inn had ███████████ us to his ██████ █████ Hussey of the
Try ████, whom he ████████ to be the ██████████ of one of the best kept
██████ in all Nantucket, and ████████ he had assured us that Cousin
Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his ████████. In short, he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-████ at
the Try Pots. But the ██████████ he had █████ us about keeping a yellow
█████████ on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the ██████, Queequeg
████████ that the yellow warehouse--our first point of █████████--must
be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had ██████████ Peter Coffin to
say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little
in the dark, and now and then knocking up a █████████ ██████████
to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
█████████.

Two enormous wooden pots ███████ black, and suspended by █████' ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
old ███████. The horns of the cross-trees were █████ off on the other
side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a ███████.
Perhaps I was over █████████ to such ███████████ at the time, but I
could not help staring at this gallows with a █████ █████████. A sort of
█████ was in my neck as I gazed up to the two █████████ horns; yes, TWO
of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A
Coffin my █████████ upon ███████ in my first whaling port; ██████████
staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair
of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out ███████ hints
touching Tophet?

I was called from these reflections by the sight of a ████████ woman
with yellow hair and a yellow ████, standing in the porch of the inn,
under a ████ red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an ███████
eye, and ████████ on a █████ ████████ with a man in a purple woollen
shirt.

"Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be ███████ ye!"

"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right. There's ███. Hussey."

And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his ███████. Upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, ██████████
further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and
███████ us at a table ██████ with the ██████ of a ████████ concluded
██████, turned round to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"

"What's that about ████, ██'am?" said I, with much ██████████.

"Clam or Cod?" she repeated.

"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
says I, "but that's a rather cold and ██████ █████████ in the winter
time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"

But being in a great hurry to ██████ scolding the man in the purple
Shirt, who was ███████ for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey ███████ towards an open door ███████ to
the ███████, and ███████ out "clam for two," disappeared.

"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clam?"

However, a warm ██████ █████ from the kitchen served to █████ the
██████████ cheerless ████████ before us. But when that smoking chowder
came in, the mystery was delightfully █████████. Oh, sweet friends!
███████ to me. It was made of small █████ clams, scarcely ██████ than
█████ ████, mixed with ███████ ship biscuit, and salted ████ cut up into
little ██████; the whole ████████ with ██████, and ███████████ ████████
with ██████ and salt. Our █████████ being █████████ by the frosty
voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite ███████ ████
before him, and the chowder being ████████████ excellent, we ██████████
it with great ██████████: when leaning back a moment and ██████████
me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod ████████████, I thought I would try
a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I ███████ the word
"cod" with great ████████, and ███████ my seat. In a few ███████ the
███████ steam came forth again, but with a different ██████, and in good
time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.

We resumed business; and while ██████ our ██████ in the bowl, thinks I
to myself, I wonder now if this here has any ██████ on the head?
What's that ███████████ saying about chowder-headed people? "But look,
Queequeg, ain't that a live ███ in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?"

████████ of all █████ places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
before the house was █████ with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished
████████ of ███████ ████████; and Hosea Hussey had his account █████
bound in ████████ old █████-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,
too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning █████████
to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw
Hosea's ████████ ███ ███████ on fish ████████, and ████████ along the
sand with each foot in a cod's ███████████ head, looking very slip-████,
I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
concerning the ███████ way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to ███████
me up the stairs, the ████ reached forth her arm, and demanded his
harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. "Why not?" said I;
"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?" "Because
it's dangerous," says she. "Ever since young ██████ coming from that
██████'██ v'█'██ of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
only three ███████ of █████, was found dead in my first floor back, with
his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take
████ dangerous ███████ in their █████ at night. So, Mr. Queequeg" (for
she had learned his name), "I will just take this here iron, and keep
it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for
breakfast, men?"

"Both," says I; "and let's have a ██████ of ██████ ███████ by way of
███████."



CHAPTER ██. The Ship.


In bed we █████████ our █████ for the morrow. But to my surprise and
no small ███████, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
diligently ██████████ ████--the name of his black little god--and Yojo
had told him two or three times over, and ████████ insisted upon it
████████, that instead of our going together among the whaling-█████ in
harbor, and in ███████ █████████ our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo
earnestly ████████ that the █████████ of the ship should rest wholly
with me, ████████ as Yojo ████████ ███████████ us; and, in order to
do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,
Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it
had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
myself, for the present ████████████ of Queequeg.

I have █████████ to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
confidence in the ██████████ of Yojo's judgment and surprising ████████
of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable ██████, as a rather good
sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all
cases did not ███████ in his ██████████ ███████.

Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection
of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little ██████
upon Queequeg's ████████ to point out the whaler best ██████ to carry
us and our ████████ ████████. But as all my █████████████ produced
no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to █████████; and ███████████
prepared to set about this business with a ██████████ ███████ sort
of ██████ and █████, that should quickly settle that ████████ little
██████. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our
little ███████--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or ███████,
or day of ███████, ███████████, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that
day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself
to it several times, I never could master his █████████ and █████
Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo
warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among
the shipping. After much prolonged ██████████ and many random █████████,
I ██████ that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The
Devil-dam, the ███-bit, and the ██████. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the
██████ of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was
the name of a ██████████ tribe of █████████████ ███████; now ███████
as the ancient █████. I ██████ and █████ about the Devil-dam; from her,
██████ over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,
looked around her for a moment, and then ███████ that this was the very
ship for us.

You may have seen many a ██████ craft in your day, for █████ I
know;--██████-████ ███████; mountainous ████████ █████; butter-box
████████, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old
school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned ████-██████ look
about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the ████████ and █████
of all four oceans, her old ████'s complexion was darkened like a French
█████████'s, who has █████ fought in █████ and Siberia. Her venerable
bows looked ███████. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,
where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood
███████ up like the ██████ of the three old kings of ███████. Her
ancient decks were ████ and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-██████████
████-stone in ██████████ █████████ where ██████ ████. But to all these
her old ███████████, were added new and marvellous ████████, ██████████
to the wild business that for more than half a ███████ she had followed.
Old Captain █████, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded
another vessel of his own, and now a ███████ seaman, and one of the
█████████ owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the ████ of his
chief-████████, had built upon her original █████████████, and ██████
it, all over, with a ██████████ both of ████████ and ██████, █████████
by anything except it be ████████-████'s carved ███████ or bedstead. She
was ██████████ like any ████████ █████████ ███████, his neck heavy with
████████ of polished ivory. She was a thing of ████████. A cannibal of
a craft, ████████ ███████ forth in the ██████ bones of her enemies. All
round, her ██████████, open bulwarks were █████████ like one ██████████
jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for
████, to ██████ her old ██████ █████ and ███████ to. Those thews ran not
through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over ███████ of
sea-ivory. ████████ a █████████ wheel at her ████████ helm, she ███████
there a ██████; and that tiller was in one mass, █████████ carved
from the long narrow lower jaw of her ██████████ ███. The ████████ who
███████ by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he █████
back his fiery █████ by █████████ its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a
most ██████████! All noble things are touched with that.

Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,
in order to propose myself as a █████████ for the voyage, at first I saw
██████; but I could not well ████████ a strange sort of ████, or
rather ██████, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only
a █████████ erection used in port. It was of a ███████ █████, some ten
feet high; ██████████ of the long, huge █████ of limber black bone taken
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.
Planted with their broad ████ on the deck, a circle of these slabs █████
together, ████████ ██████ towards each other, and at the ████ united in
a tufted point, where the █████ █████ ██████ █████ to and fro like the
top-knot on some old █████████████ ██████'s head. A ██████████ opening
faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the ███████ commanded a
complete view forward.

And half █████████ in this queer ████████, I at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being ████, and
the ship's work suspended, was now ████████ ███████ from the burden of
command. He was seated on an old-fashioned █████ chair, wriggling all
over with curious ███████; and the bottom of which was formed of a
█████ ███████████ of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
███████████.

There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
the ███████ man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
and ███████ rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the ██████ style;
only there was a fine and almost ███████████ ███-work of the ████████
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have ██████ from
his continual ████████ in many hard █████, and always looking to
████████;--for this ██████ the ███████ about the eyes to become ██████
together. Such eye-wrinkles are very █████████ in a █████.

"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, █████████ to the door of
the tent.

"█████████ it be the captain of the Pequod, what ████ thou want of him?"
he demanded.

"I was thinking of shipping."

"Thou ████, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in a
stove boat?"

"No, Sir, I never have."

"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--██?

"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been several
voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--"

"Merchant service be ██████. Talk not that █████ to me. Dost see that
leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou ███████ of
the ████████ service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now
ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.
But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks
a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast
thou?--█████ not ███ thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think of
█████████ the ████████ when thou ███████ to sea?"

I █████████ my █████████ of these things. I saw that under the ████
of these half ████████ ██████████, this old seaman, as an █████████
█████████ Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
███████████ of all ██████, unless they ██████ from Cape Cod or the
████████.

"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
shipping ye."

"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world."

"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye ███████ eye on Captain ████?"

"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"

"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."

"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself."

"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,
young man. It belongs to me and Captain ██████ to see the Pequod fitted
out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
are part owners and ██████. But as I was going to say, if thou ███████
to know what whaling is, as thou ███████ ye do, I can put ye in a way of
finding it out before ye ████ yourself to it, past backing out. ████
eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou ████ find that he has only one
leg."

"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?"

"Lost by a whale! Young man, come ██████ to me: it was ████████,
██████ up, ████████ by the ████████████ ██████████ that ever ███████ a
boat!--ah, ah!"

I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
the ██████ grief in his concluding ███████████, but said as calmly as I
could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
there was any peculiar ████████ in that particular whale, though indeed
I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the ████████."

"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou
dost not talk shark a bit. SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure of
that?"

"Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
merchant--"

"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
service--don't █████████ me--I won't have it. But let us understand each
other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
████████ for it?"

"I do, sir."

"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's
throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!"

"I am, sir, if it should be ██████████ █████████████ to do so; not to be
got ███ of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."

"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
out by ██████████ what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just
step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there."

For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious ███████, not
knowing exactly how to take it, whether ██████████ or in earnest. But
█████████████ all his ████'s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
me on the errand.

Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I █████████ that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now █████████
pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was █████████, but
exceedingly ██████████ and ██████████; not the slightest variety that I
could see.

"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye
see?"

"Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable ███████ though,
and there's a ██████ coming up, I think."

"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where
you stand?"

I was a little █████████, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now
repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he █████████ his ███████████
to ship me.

"And thou ██████ as well sign the papers right off," he added--"come
along with ye." And so saying, he led the way █████ deck into the cabin.

Seated on the ███████ was what seemed to me a most ████████ and
surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
██████, as is sometimes the case in these █████, being held by a crowd
of old ██████████; widows, ██████████ children, and ████████ wards; each
██████ about the value of a ██████ head, or a foot of plank, or a ████
or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling
vessels, the same way that you do █████ in ████████ state ██████
bringing in good interest.

Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
Quaker, the island having been ██████████ settled by that ████; and to
this day its ███████████ in general ██████ in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the Quaker, only █████████ and ███████████ ████████
by things altogether █████ and █████████████. For some of these same
███████ are the most ██████████ of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
are ████████ Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.

So that there are █████████ among them of men, who, named with █████████
names--a ██████████ common ███████ on the island--and in █████████
naturally ████████ the stately ████████ thee and thou of the Quaker
█████; still, from the █████████, daring, and boundless adventure
of their subsequent lives, strangely █████ with these ██████████
peculiarities, a thousand bold ██████ of character, not ████████ a
████████████ sea-king, or a ████████ Pagan Roman. And when these things
unite in a man of ███████ superior ███████ █████, with a ████████ brain
and a ponderous heart; who has also by the █████████ and █████████
of many long night-███████ in the remotest waters, and beneath
██████████████ never seen here at the north, been led to think
███████████████ and █████████████; receiving all nature's sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own ██████ █████████ and █████████
breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from ██████████
██████████, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes
one in a whole ██████'s census--a mighty ███████ creature, formed for
noble tragedies. Nor will it at all ███████ from him, ████████████
regarded, if either by █████ or other circumstances, he have what seems
a half wilful ██████████ ██████████ at the bottom of his nature. For all
men ██████████ great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure
of this, O young ████████, all mortal █████████ is but ███████. But,
as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and
still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only ███████ again from another
█████ of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
But unlike Captain Peleg--who █████ not a rush for what are called
serious things, and indeed ██████ those self-same serious things the
███████ of all ███████--Captain Bildad had not only been originally
████████ █████████ to the █████████ sect of Nantucket █████████, but all
his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many ██████, ██████ island
creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born
Quaker one single ███, had not so much as ███████ one angle of his
████. Still, for all this █████████████, was there some ████ of
common ███████████ about worthy Captain Peleg. Though ████████, from
conscientious ████████, to bear arms against land ████████, yet himself
had ███████████ ███████ the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a █████ foe
to human █████████, yet had he in his straight-██████ coat, ███████ ████
upon tuns of leviathan ████. How now in the █████████████ evening of his
days, the █████ Bildad reconciled these things in the ████████████, I do
not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
he had long since come to the ████ and sensible conclusion that a man's
████████ is one thing, and this █████████ world quite another. This
world pays █████████. ██████ from a little cabin-boy in short clothes
of the ████████ ████, to a harpooneer in a broad ████-███████ waistcoat;
from that ████████ boat-██████, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a
ship █████; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous
██████ by wholly ████████ from active life at the ██████ age of
sixty, and ██████████ his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his
well-██████ ██████.

Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
████████████ old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
████-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sailed the old ███████ whaleman, his crew,
upon ████████ home, were mostly all carried ashore to the ████████, sore
█████████ and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was
certainly rather hard-███████, to say the least. He never used to █████,
though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an ██████████
quantity of █████, ███████████ hard work out of them. When Bildad was a
chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made
you feel completely nervous, till you could ██████ something--a ██████
or a ███████-█████, and go to work like mad, at something or other,
never mind what. █████████ and ████████ perished before him. His own
person was the █████ ██████████ of his ███████████ character. On his
long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no ███████████ █████,
his ████ having a soft, ██████████ ███ to it, like the worn nap of his
broad-███████ hat.

Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,
and never leaned, and this to save his coat █████. His broad-████ was
placed ██████ him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab ███████ was
████████ up to his chin; and ██████████ on nose, he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous ██████.

"Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
████████ those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain
█████████. How far ye got, Bildad?"

As if long ██████████ to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
Bildad, without ████████ his present ███████████, quietly looked up, and
seeing me, glanced again ███████████ towards Peleg.

"He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he █████ to ship."

"Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow ████, and turning round to me.

"I dost," said I █████████████, he was so intense a Quaker.

"What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.

"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on ████████ away at
his book in a ████████ tone quite ███████.

I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a █████████. But I said
nothing, only looking round me ███████. Peleg now threw open a chest,
and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed ███ and ███ before him,
and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
to settle with myself at what terms I would be ███████ to ██████ for the
voyage. I was already █████ that in the whaling business they paid no
wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of
the ███████ called lays, and that these lays were ████████████ to the
degree of ██████████ pertaining to the ██████████ ██████ of the ship's
company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own
lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,
could █████ a ship, ██████ a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that
from all I had heard I should be offered at least the █████ lay--that
is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever
that might ██████████ amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they
call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a
█████ voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the ████████ I would wear out
on it, not to speak of my three years' ████ and board, for which I would
not have to pay one ██████.

It might be thought that this was a poor way to ██████████ a ████████
███████--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim
sign of the Thunder █████. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay
would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I
been offered the █████, considering I was of a broad-██████████ make.

But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a ████████ share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old █████ Bildad;
how that they being the principal ███████████ of the Pequod, therefore
the other and more ██████████████ and scattered owners, left nearly the
whole ██████████ of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know
but what the ██████ old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
own ████████. Now while Peleg was ██████ trying to ████ a pen with his
jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was
such an interested █████ in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded
us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, "LAY not up for
██████████ █████████ upon earth, where ████--"

"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay
shall we give this young man?"

"Thou ███████ best," was the ██████████ █████, "the seven hundred and
███████-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and ████ do
███████, but LAY--'"

LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.
It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the
magnitude of the figure it might at first ███████ a ████████, yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make
a ██████ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh part of a ████████ is a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventy-seven gold █████████; and so I thought at the time.

"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to
███████ this young man! he must have more than that."

"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without lifting
his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your ████████ is, there
will your heart be also."

"I am going to put him down for the three █████████," said Peleg, "do ye
hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say."

Bildad laid down his book, and turning ████████ towards him said,
"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
duty thou █████ to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,
many of them--and that if we too ██████████ ██████ the ██████ of this
young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg."

"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
cabin. "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy ██████ in these
matters, I would afore now had a conscience to ███ about that would be
heavy enough to ███████ the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
Horn."

"Captain Peleg," said Bildad ████████, "thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still
an ██████████ man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear ████ thy conscience be
but a █████ one; and will in the end ████ thee foundering down to the
fiery pit, Captain Peleg."

"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye ██████ me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
insult me. It's an all-█████ ███████ to tell any human creature that
he's bound to hell. Flukes and ██████! Bildad, say that again to me, and
start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live ████ with
all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye ███████, drab-coloured
son of a wooden ███--a straight wake with ye!"

As he █████████ out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
oblique, ███████ ████████, Bildad for that time ██████ him.

Alarmed at this terrible ████████ between the two principal and
███████████ owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of ███████ in a vessel so ████████████ █████ and ███████████
commanded, I ███████ aside from the door to give ██████ to Bildad, who,
I made no doubt, was all eagerness to ██████ from before the awakened
wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
███████████. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As
for Peleg, after ███████ off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still █████████ ████████. "████!" he ████████ at last--"the
squall's gone off to ███████, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at
██████████ a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
the ██████████. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,
Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
for the three hundredth lay."

"Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship
too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?"

"To be sure," said Peleg. "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."

"What lay does he want?" ███████ Bildad, glancing up from the book in
which he had again been ███████ himself.

"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg. "Has he ever
██████ it any?" turning to me.

"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."

"Well, bring him along then."

And, after ███████ the papers, off I went; nothing ████████ but that I
had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical
ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain
with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in
many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all
her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving
to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the
shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have
a family, or any █████████ concernment of that sort, he does not trouble
himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till
all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at
him before ███████████ ██████████ yourself into his hands. Turning back
I accosted Captain Peleg, █████████ where Captain Ahab was to be found.

"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou
art shipped."

"Yes, but I should like to see him."

"But I don't think thou wilt be ████ to at present. I don't know exactly
what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort
of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he
███'t well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I
don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some
think--but a good one. Oh, thou'██ like him well enough; no fear, no
fear. He's a grand, ███████, god-like man, Captain Ahab; █████'t speak
much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be
██████████; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in ████████, as well as
'████ the cannibals; been used to deeper ███████ than the waves; fixed
his fiery lance in mightier, stranger ████ than whales. His lance!
aye, the ███████ and the ██████ that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't
Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab
of old, thou knowest, was a ███████ king!"

"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
they not ████ his blood?"

"Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg, with a ████████████ in
his eye that almost startled me. "Look ye, lad; never say that on board
the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
'████ a ███████, ignorant ████ of his crazy, ███████ mother, who died
when he was only a ███████████ old. And yet the old █████ ██████, at
███████, said that the name would somehow prove █████████. And, perhaps,
other █████ like her may tell thee the same. I wish to ████ thee. It's a
lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago;
I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but
a ████████ good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of
him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on
the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it
was the sharp shooting pains in his ████████ █████ that brought that
about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost
his leg last voyage by that ████████ whale, he's been a kind of
moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass
off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's
better to sail with a moody good captain than a ████████ bad one. So
good-███ to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he ███████ to
have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages
wedded--a sweet, ████████ ████. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless
harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
██████████!"

As I ██████ away, I was full of ██████████████; what had been
████████████ ████████ to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
wild █████████ of ███████████ concerning him. And somehow, at the time,
I felt a ████████ and a ██████ for him, but for I don't know what,
unless it was the cruel ████ of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all ████████, was
not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did
not ██████████ me towards him; though I felt ██████████ at what seemed
like mystery in him, so ███████████ as he was known to me then. However,
my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the
present dark Ahab slipped my mind.



CHAPTER ██. The Ramadan.


As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to ████████ all
day, I did not ██████ to ███████ him till towards night-fall; for I
cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's █████████ ███████████,
never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to ██████████
even a congregation of ████ worshipping a ████-█████; or those other
creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of ██████████
quite █████████████ in other ███████, bow down before the █████ of
a ████████ landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
███████████ yet owned and ██████ in his name.

I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so ██████ superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
████████. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
██████ ███████ about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that? Queequeg
thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
and there let him rest. All our ███████ with him would not █████; let
him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all--█████████████ and Pagans
alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
sadly need ███████.

Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
███████ must be over, I went up to his room and ███████ at the door; but
no answer. I tried to open it, but it was ████████ inside. "Queequeg,"
said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent. "I say, Queequeg! why
don't you speak? It's I--Ishmael." But all remained still as before. I
began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought
he might have had an ██████████ fit. I looked through the key-hole; but
the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect
was but a crooked and ████████ one. I could only see part of the
foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I
was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden █████ of
Queequeg's harpoon, which the ████████ the evening previous had taken
from him, before our mounting to the ███████. That's strange, thought I;
but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or
never goes ██████ without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no
possible mistake.

"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still. Something must have happened.
████████! I tried to burst open the door; but it ██████████ ████████.
Running down stairs, I quickly ██████ my suspicions to the first person
I met--the chamber-████. "██! la!" she cried, "I thought something must
be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
locked; and not a █████ to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever
since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma'am!--████████! ██████! Mrs.
Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
following.

Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a ███████-pot in one hand and a
███████-█████ in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
of attending to the ███████, and scolding her little black boy meantime.

"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it? Run for God's sake, and fetch
something to ███ open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a stroke;
depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
again empty-██████, when Mrs. Hussey ██████████ the mustard-pot and
vinegar-cruet, and the entire ██████ of her countenance.

"What's the matter with you, young man?"

"Get the axe! For God's sake, run for the ██████, some one, while I pry
it open!"

"Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
so as to have one hand free; "look here; are you ███████ about ██████
open any of my doors?"--and with that she ██████ my arm. "What's the
matter with you? What's the matter with you, shipmate?"

In as calm, but █████ a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
whole case. Unconsciously ████████ the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
nose, she █████████ for an instant; then exclaimed--"No! I █████'t seen
it since I put it there." Running to a little ██████ under the landing
of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's
harpoon was missing. "He's killed himself," she cried. "It's unfort'████
Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane--God pity his poor
mother!--it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad a sister?
Where's that girl?--there, █████, go to ███████ the ███████, and tell
him to paint me a sign, with--"no ████████ █████████ here, and no
smoking in the parlor;"--might as well kill both █████ at once. Kill?
The Lord be ████████ to his █████! What's that noise there? You, young
man, avast there!"

And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
open the door.

"I don't allow it; I won't have my ████████ ███████. Go for the
█████████, there's one about a ████ from here. But avast!" putting her
hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's
see." And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg's
████████████ bolt remained ███████████ within.

"Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a
little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again ██████
I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a
sudden bodily rush ██████ myself full against the mark.

With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the ████ ████████
against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-█████████; right
in the middle of the room; █████████ on his ████, and holding Yojo on
top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter with
you?"

"He ████'t been a ██████' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.

But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
like ███████ him over, so as to ██████ his position, for it was almost
███████████, it seemed so █████████ and ███████████ ███████████;
especially, as in all ███████████ he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours, going too without his regular █████.

"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you
please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."

███████ the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
do--for all my polite arts and █████████████--he would not move a ███,
nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
the slightest way.

I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
yes, it's part of his █████, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll
get up sooner or █████, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank God,
and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't believe it's very
████████ then.

I went down to supper. After sitting a long time █████████ to the long
stories of some sailors who had just come from a ████-███████ voyage, as
they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or ████,
████████ to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
listening to these plum-██████████ till nearly ██████ o'clock, I went
up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
certainly have brought his Ramadan to a ███████████. But no; there he
was just where I had left him; he had not ███████ an inch. I began to
grow █████ with him; it seemed so downright █████████ and ██████ to be
sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
holding a piece of wood on his head.

"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
some supper. You'll ██████; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg." But not a
word did he reply.

██████████ of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
it ████████ to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into
the ████████ doze. I had █████ out the candle; and the mere thought
of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that ██████ position,
stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of
it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!

But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
day; when, looking over the ███████, there ████████ Queequeg, as if he
had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and ███████ joints,
but with a ████████ look; ██████ towards me where I lay; pressed his
forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.

Now, as I before hinted, I have no █████████ to any person's religion,
be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when
a man's religion ███████ really ███████; when it is a ████████ ███████
to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ████ an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
█████ the point with him.

And just so I now did with Queequeg. "Queequeg," said I, "get into bed
now, and lie and listen to me." I then went on, beginning with the rise
and progress of the █████████ █████████, and coming down to the various
religions of the present time, during which time I ███████ to show
Queequeg that all these █████, ████████, and prolonged ███-██████████ in
cold, cheerless rooms were stark ████████; bad for the ██████; ███████
for the soul; ███████, in short, to the obvious ████ of ███████ and
common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an
█████████ sensible and █████████ savage, it ██████ me, very badly pained
me, to see him now so ██████████ foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan
of his. Besides, ██████ I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the
spirit █████ in; and all thoughts born of a fast must ███████████ be
half-███████. This is the reason why most dyspeptic ████████████ cherish
such melancholy notions about their ██████████. In one word, Queequeg,
said I, rather ████████████; hell is an idea first born on an ██████████
█████-████████; and since then ███████████ through the hereditary
██████████ ████████ by Ramadans.

I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
█████████; ██████████ the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
in. He said no; only upon one █████████ occasion. It was after a great
feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the █████ had been killed by about two o'clock in the
afternoon, and all ██████ and █████ that very evening.

"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew the
██████████ without his further ███████ them. I had seen a sailor who had
visited that very island, and he told me that it was the ██████, when
a great battle had been gained there, to ████████ all the slain in the
████ or garden of the ██████; and then, one by one, they were placed
in great wooden █████████, and garnished round like a █████, with
██████████ and cocoanuts; and with some ███████ in their ██████, were
sent round with the victor's ███████████ to all his friends, just as
though these ████████ were so many █████████ ███████.

After all, I do not think that my ███████ about religion made much
██████████ upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his
own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one
third understand me, █████ my ideas ██████ as I would; and, finally, he
no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than
I did. He looked at me with a sort of █████████████ concern and
██████████, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so ██████████ lost to ███████████ pagan █████.

At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a ████████████ hearty
breakfast of chowders of all █████, so that the landlady should not
make much ██████ by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with ███████ bones.



CHAPTER ██. His Mark.


As we were ███████ down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his █████ voice ██████ hailed us
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and furthermore ██████████ that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
unless they previously produced their papers.

"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

"I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."

"Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam. "He must show that he's █████████.
Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art thou at present in
█████████ with any Christian church?"

"Why," said I, "he's a ██████ of the first ██████████████ Church." Here
be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churches.

"First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that ████████ in
██████ ███████████ Coleman's ███████-house?" and so saying, taking
out his spectacles, he ██████ them with his great yellow ███████
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
Queequeg.

"How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not very
long, I rather guess, young man."

"No," said Peleg, "and he ████'t been baptized right either, or it would
have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."

"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this ██████████ a regular member of
Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
every Lord's day."

"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said
I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."

"Young man," said Bildad ███████, "thou art skylarking with me--explain
███████, thou young ███████. What church dost thee mean? answer me."

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. "I mean, sir, the same
ancient ████████ Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of
us ██████; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
queer █████████ no ways touching the grand ██████; in THAT we all join
hands."

"Splice, thou mean'██ SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer. "Young
man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand;
I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple
himself couldn't beat it, and he's ████████ something. Come aboard, come
aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell ██████ there--what's
that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what
a harpoon he's got there! looks like good stuff that; and he ███████ it
about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"

Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and ███████ his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--

"███'ain, you see him small drop tar on water ████? You see him? well,
█████ him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp ███ at it, he
darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across the
ship's decks, and struck the ██████████ tar spot out of sight.

"Now," said Queequeg, quietly ███████ in the line, "████-ee him whale-e
eye; why, ███ whale dead."

"Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had █████████ towards the cabin gangway.
"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers. We must have
████████ there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog,
we'll give ye the █████████ lay, and that's more than ever was given a
harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."

So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.

When all █████████████ were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't know how
to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
make thy mark?"

But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ██████████, looked no ways ███████; but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
███████████ of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
that through Captain Peleg's █████████ mistake touching his ███████████,
it stood something like this:--

Quohog. his █ mark.

Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broad-███████ drab coat, took out a ██████ of ██████, and selecting
one ████████ "The ██████ Day Coming; or No Time to ████," placed it in
Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, "Son of darkness, I must do my
duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
souls of all its crew; if thou still ████████ to thy Pagan ways, which I
sadly fear, I ███████ thee, ██████ not for aye a ██████ ████████. █████
the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
thine eye, I say; oh! goodness ████████! steer clear of the fiery pit!"

Something of the salt sea yet ████████ in old Bildad's language,
███████████████ mixed with ██████████ and ████████ ███████.

"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now ████████ our harpooneer,"
cried Peleg. "Pious harpooneers never make good ████████--it takes the shark
out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a █████ who aint pretty ████████.
There was young Nat ██████, once the ███████ boat-header out of all
Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to
good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he ████████ and
███████ away from whales, for fear of after-█████, in case he got stove
and went to ████ █████."

"Peleg! Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, "thou thyself,
as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou █████ in this
ungodly guise. Thou ███████ thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this
same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that ███████ on Japan,
that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did'st thou not
think of Death and the Judgment then?"

"Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
█████████ his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.
Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
everlasting ██████████ against the side; and every sea breaking over us,
fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think
about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of;
and how to save all hands--how to ███ ████-masts--how to get into the
nearest port; that was what I was thinking of."

Bildad said no more, but █████████ up his coat, ███████ on deck,
where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly ███████████ some
██████████ who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then
he stooped to ████ up a █████, or save an end of ██████ █████, which
otherwise might have been ██████.



CHAPTER ██. The Prophet.


"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?"

Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
████████ his ███████ ██████████ at the vessel in question. He was but
████████ apparelled in █████ jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief █████████ his neck. A █████████ small-███ had in all
directions ██████ over his face, and left it like the ███████████ ██████
bed of a ███████, when the rushing waters have been █████ up.

"Have ye shipped in her?" he repeated.

"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, trying to gain a little
more time for an █████████████ look at him.

"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole
arm, and then ███████ ███████ it straight out from him, with the fixed
███████ of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

"Yes," said I, "we have just ██████ the articles."

"Anything down there about your souls?"

"About what?"

"Oh, perhaps you ███'n't got any," he said quickly. "No matter though,
I know many █████ that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em; and they are
all the better off for it. A soul's a sort of a █████ wheel to a █████."

"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.

"HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all ████████████ of that sort
in other chaps," ████████ said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis
upon the word HE.

"Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he's talking about something and ████████ we don't know."

"Stop!" cried the stranger. "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old Thunder
yet, have ye?"

"Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again ███████ with the insane ███████████
of his manner.

"Captain Ahab."

"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"

"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"

"No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
all right again before long."

"All right again before long!" ███████ the stranger, with a solemnly
████████ sort of laugh. "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."

"What do you know about him?"

"What did they TELL you about him? Say that!"

"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that he's
a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."

"That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
he gives an order. Step and █████; growl and go--that's the word with
Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape
Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
nothing about that deadly █████████ with the ████████ afore the █████ in
█████?--heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash
he ████ into? And nothing about his ██████ his leg last voyage,
according to the ████████. Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and
something more, eh? No, I don't think ye did; how could ye? Who knows
it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But ████'ever, ██████, ye've heard tell
about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare
say. Oh yes, THAT every one knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one
leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off."

"My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must be a
little ███████ in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of
that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about
the loss of his leg."

"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?"

"Pretty sure."

With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the ██████-like
stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled ███████; then starting a
little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the
papers? Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be;
and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. ██████, it's all fixed
and ████████ a'ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I
suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em! Morning to ye,
shipmates, morning; the █████████ heavens █████ ye; I'm sorry I stopped
ye."

"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell
us, out with it; but if you are only trying to █████████ us, you are
mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."

"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
you are just the man for him--the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded not to make one
of 'em."

"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't ████ us that way--you can't fool us. It
is the ███████ thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great
██████ in him."

"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."

"Morning it is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy
man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?"

"██████."

Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both ██████████, after each
other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
nothing but a ██████, trying to be a ███████. But we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when ████████ to turn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was ███████
us, but with what ██████ I could not for the life of me ███████. This
circumstance, ███████ with his █████████, half-hinting, half-revealing,
████████ sort of talk, now █████ in me all █████ of vague ███████████
and half-█████████████, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
the day previous; and the ██████████ of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage
we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other ███████ things.

I was resolved to ███████ myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
and on that side of it ████████ our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
seeming to notice us. This ████████ me; and once more, and finally as it
seemed to me, I ██████████ him in my heart, a humbug.



CHAPTER ██. All █████.


A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
board, and bolts of canvas, and █████ of rigging; in short, everything
█████████ that the ship's ████████████ were ████████ to a close. Captain
Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the ██████████ and █████████
at the ██████; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
working till long after night-fall.

On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at
all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their ██████
must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon
the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our █████,
█████████, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
was fully ████████.

Every one knows what a multitude of things--████, █████-pans, ██████
and █████, ███████ and █████, ███████, ███-████████, and what not, are
indispensable to the business of ████████████. Just so with whaling,
which ████████████ a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,
far from all ███████, █████████████, ███████, ██████, and ███████. And
though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
to the same ██████ as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the
whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery, and the █████████████ of █████████ them at the remote ███████
usually ██████████, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling
vessels are the most ███████ to accidents of all kinds, and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the ███████ of
the voyage most ███████. Hence, the spare boats, spare █████, and spare
lines and harpoons, and spare ███████████, almost, but a spare Captain
and █████████ ship.

At the ██████ of our ███████ at the Island, the ████████ ███████ of the
Pequod had been almost completed; ██████████ her beef, bread, water,
████, and iron hoops and ██████. But, as before hinted, for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers ████ and
ends of things, both large and small.

Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and █████████████
spirit, but withal very ███████████, who seemed resolved that, if SHE
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once
fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a ███
of ███████ for the ███████'s ██████; another time with a █████ of quills
for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his ███; a third time with a
roll of ███████ for the small of some one's █████████ back. Never did
any woman better ███████ her name, which was ███████--████ Charity, as
everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable
Aunt Charity ██████ about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand
and heart to anything that promised to █████ ██████, ███████, and
███████████ to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a █████ or two of
well-saved dollars.

But it was █████████ to see this excellent hearted █████████ coming on
board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-█████ in one hand, and
a still ██████ whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
a long ████ of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
went his mark opposite that ███████ upon the paper. Every once in a
while Peleg came ████████ out of his █████████ den, roaring at the men
down the █████████, roaring up to the ███████ at the mast-head, and then
concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.

During these days of ███████████, Queequeg and I often visited the
craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when
he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would
answer, that he was getting better and better, and was ████████ aboard
every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend
to everything █████████ to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been
downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart
that I did but half fancy being █████████ this way to so long a voyage,
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the ████████
████████ of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.
But when a man ████████ any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be
already ████████ in the matter, he ██████████ ███████ to cover up his
suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said
nothing, and tried to think nothing.

At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.



CHAPTER ██. Going Aboard.


It was nearly six o'clock, but only ████ █████████ misty ████, when we
drew nigh the wharf.

"There are some sailors running █████ there, if I see right," said I to
Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess; come on!"

"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind
us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then ███████████ himself
between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the █████████ ████████,
strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.

"Going aboard?"

"Hands off, will you," said I.

"██████ here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

"Ain't going aboard, then?"

"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know,
Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little ███████████?"

"No, no, no; I ████'t aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and
███████████ looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
glances.

"Elijah," said I, "you will ██████ my friend and me by withdrawing. We
are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would ██████ not to be
████████."

"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?"

"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."

"██████!" cried ██████████ Elijah, ███████ us when we had removed a few
█████.

"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."

But he █████ up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while ago?"

Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, "Yes,
I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure."

"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah. "Morning to ye."

Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will ye?

"Find who?"

"Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he ████████, again moving off. "Oh! I
was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all one,
all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? Good-bye to
ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand
Jury." And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for
the moment, in no small ██████████ at his frantic █████████.

At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
hatches were all on, and ████████ with coils of rigging. Going forward
to the forecastle, we found the █████ of the ███████ open. Seeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old ██████ there, wrapped in a
████████ pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The ███████████ ███████
slept upon him.

"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said I,
looking █████████ at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now ███████ to; hence I would
have thought myself to have been █████████ ████████ in that matter,
were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the
thing down; and again ███████ the sleeper, █████████ hinted to Queequeg
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to █████████
himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though
feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly
down there.

"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.

"Oh! █████ ████ seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't ████ him
face."

"Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
but how hard he breathes, he's ███████ himself; get off, Queequeg, you
are heavy, it's ████████ the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,
he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake."

Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon ███████████ him
in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
land, owing to the ███████ of ███████ and █████ of all sorts, the king,
██████, and great people generally, were in the custom of █████████ some
of the lower orders for ████████; and to furnish a house ███████████ in
that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten ████ fellows, and lay
them round in the █████ and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on
an █████████; much better than those garden-chairs which are ███████████
into walking-██████; upon occasion, a chief calling his █████████, and
████████ him to make a ██████ of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps
in some damp ██████ place.

While █████████ these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
from me, he ██████████ the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.

"What's that for, Queequeg?"

"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!"

He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both ███████ his foes and ███████
his soul, when we were directly █████████ to the sleeping rigger. The
strong ██████ now completely ███████ the contracted hole, it began
to tell upon him. He ████████ with a sort of ███████████; then seemed
troubled in the nose; then ████████ over once or twice; then sat up and
rubbed his eyes.

"Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye ███████?"

"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"

"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
came aboard last night."

"What Captain?--Ahab?"

"Who but him indeed?"

I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck.

"Holloa! ████████'s astir," said the rigger. "He's a ██████ chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to." And so
saying he went on deck, and we followed.

It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers █████████ themselves; the mates were ████████
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained █████████
█████████ within his cabin.



CHAPTER ██. Merry Christmas.


At length, towards noon, upon the final █████████ of the ship's riggers,
and after the Pequod had been ██████ out from the wharf, and after the
ever-██████████ Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last
████--a night-cap for █████, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a
spare Bible for the steward--after all this, the two Captains, Peleg
and Bildad, ██████ from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg
said:

"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is
all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
Well, call all hands, then. ██████ 'em aft here--blast 'em!"

"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said Bildad,
"but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."

How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-██████████ at sea, as
well as to all ███████████ in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of
him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,
the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
ship under █████, and ████████ her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was
not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not
yet completely █████████--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed
below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant
service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,
having a ████████ merry-making with their shore friends, before they
quit the ship for good with the pilot.

But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and
██████████, and not Bildad.

"Aft here, ye ████ of █████████," he cried, as the sailors lingered at
the main-mast. "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft."

"Strike the tent there!"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this
whalebone ███████ was never pitched except in port; and on board the
Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

"Man the ███████! Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command, and
the crew sprang for the ██████████.

Now in getting under weigh, the ███████ generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
known, in ████████ to his other officers, was one of the ████████ ██████
of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
order to save the Nantucket pilot-███ to all the ships he was concerned
in, for he never ███████ any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now
be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the ███████████
anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,
to █████ the hands at the ████████, who roared forth some sort of
a ██████ about the girls in ██████ █████, with hearty good will.
Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no
profane █████ would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of █████ in each seaman's berth.

Meantime, ██████████ the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ██████
and swore astern in the most █████████ manner. I almost thought he would
sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused
on my █████████, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the
perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilot. I was ██████████ myself, however, with the thought that in pious
Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and
seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp ████ in my rear, and
turning round, was █████████ at the ██████████ of Captain Peleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first
kick.

"Is that the way they █████ in the marchant service?" he roared.
"Spring, thou █████-head; spring, and break thy ████████! Why don't ye
spring, I say, all of ye--spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
████████; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green █████. Spring, I
say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!" And so saying, he moved
along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
█████████████ Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,
Captain Peleg must have been ████████ something to-day.

At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day ██████ into
night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the ██████ ocean, whose
freezing spray █████ us in ice, as in polished █████. The long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
ivory █████ of some huge ████████, vast ███████ icicles ████████ from
the bows.

████ Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost
all over her, and the winds ██████, and the ███████ ████, his steady
█████ were heard,--

"Sweet fields beyond the ████████ flood, Stand dressed in living green.
So to the ████ old Canaan stood, While ██████ rolled between."


Never did those sweet words sound more ███████ to me than then. They
were full of hope and ████████. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous Atlantic, spite of my ███ feet and ██████ jacket, there was
yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in █████; and █████
and ██████ so █████████ ██████, that the grass shot up by the spring,
█████████, ████████, ███████ at █████████.

At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed
no longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ███████
█████████.

It was curious and not ██████████, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
this ████████, especially Captain Bildad. For █████ to ██████, yet;
very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyage--beyond both ██████ █████; a ship in which some thousands of
his hard earned dollars were ████████; a ship, in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
█████████ all the terrors of the ████████ jaw; loath to say good-bye to
a thing so every way ███████ of every interest to him,--poor old Bildad
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious ███████; ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
███████ by the far-off unseen ███████ ██████████; looked towards
the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere
and nowhere; and at last, mechanically ███████ a rope upon its ███,
████████████ ███████ stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a ███████,
for a moment stood ██████ ██████████ in his face, as much as to say,
"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can."

As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
his philosophy, there was a ████ █████████ in his eye, when the lantern
came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck--now
a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.

But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last. Luck to ye,
Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. █████--good-bye and
good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot supper
smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!"

"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," ████████ old
Bildad, almost ████████████. "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
Be careful in the ████, ye mates. Don't stave the boats ██████████,
ye harpooneers; good white █████ plank is raised full three ███ ████.
within the year. Don't ██████ your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind
that cooper don't waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
the green ██████! Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't
████ a fair chance either, that's █████████ Heaven's good █████. Have an
eye to the molasses ██████, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.
If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, ██████ of ███████████. Good-bye,
good-bye! Don't keep that ██████ too long down in the hold, Mr.
Starbuck; it'll spoil. Be careful with the butter--twenty █████ the
█████ it was, and mind ye, if--"

"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop ██████████,--away!" and with that,
Peleg hurried him over the side, and both █████ into the boat.

Ship and boat ████████; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
█████████ gull flew overhead; the two █████ wildly rolled; we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers, and ███████ plunged like fate into the ████
Atlantic.



CHAPTER ██. The Lee Shore.


Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, █████████
mariner, ███████████ in New Bedford at the inn.

When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her ██████████
bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and ███████████ upon
the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years' dangerous
voyage, could so ███████████ ████ off again for still another
tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. █████████████
things are ever the █████████████; deep ████████ yield no ████████; this
six-inch chapter is the █████████ grave of Bulkington. Let me only say
that it █████ with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that █████████
██████ along the leeward land. The port would fain give ██████; the port
is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, ███████████, supper, warm
████████, friends, all that's kind to our ███████████. But in that gale,
the port, the land, is that ship's ██████ jeopardy; she must fly all
███████████; one touch of land, though it but █████ the keel, would make
her ███████ through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail
off shore; in so doing, ██████ '██████ the very winds that fain would
████ her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's ████████████ again;
for refuge's sake █████████ rushing into █████; her only friend her
█████████ foe!

Know ye now, Bulkington? ████████ do ye seem to see of that ████████
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the ████████
effort of the soul to keep the open ████████████ of her sea; while
the ███████ winds of heaven and earth ████████ to cast her on the
treacherous, slavish shore?

But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, █████████,
indefinite as God--so, better is it to ██████ in that howling ████████,
than be ████████████ dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!
For worm-like, then, oh! who would ██████ crawl to land! Terrors of
the terrible! is all this █████ so vain? Take heart, take heart,
O Bulkington! Bear thee ██████, ███████! Up from the spray of thy
ocean-█████████--straight up, leaps thy ██████████!



CHAPTER ██. The ████████.


As Queequeg and I are now fairly ████████ in this business of whaling;
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather ██████████ and ████████████ pursuit; therefore, I
am all ███████ to ████████ ye, ye landsmen, of the █████████ ██████ done
to us hunters of whales.

In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
█████████ on a █████ with what are called the ███████ ███████████. If a
stranger were introduced into any █████████████ ████████████ society,
it would but slightly ███████ the general opinion of his ██████, were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in █████████
of the █████ officers he should ██████ the ████████ S.█.█. (Sperm
Whale Fishery) to his ████████ ████, such a █████████ would be deemed
███-█████████ █████████ and ridiculous.

Doubtless one leading reason why the world ████████ █████████ us
whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation ███████ to a
██████████ sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
are surrounded by all manner of ███████████. ████████ we are, that is
true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the █████████ █████ have been
all ███████ Commanders whom the world ██████████ delights to honour. And
as for the matter of the ███████ █████████████ of our business, ye shall
soon be █████████ into certain █████ hitherto pretty generally unknown,
and which, upon the whole, will ████████████ plant the sperm whale-ship
at least among the ██████████ things of this ████ earth. But even
████████ the charge in question to be true; what disordered ████████
decks of a whale-ship are ██████████ to the unspeakable ███████ of those
battle-fields from which so many ████████ return to drink in all ladies'
████████? And if the idea of peril so much ████████ the popular ███████
of the ███████'s ██████████; let me assure ye that many a ███████
who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly ██████ at the
apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, ███████ into ██████ the air
over his head. For what are the ██████████████ terrors of man ████████
with the ███████████ terrors and wonders of God!

But, though the world ██████ at us whale hunters, yet does it
███████████ pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-█████████
█████████! for almost all the ██████, █████, and candles that burn round
the globe, burn, as before so many ███████, to our glory!

But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.

Why did the Dutch in ██ ████'s time have ████████ of their whaling
██████? Why did █████ ███. of ██████, at his own ████████ ███████, fit
out whaling ships from ███████, and politely ██████ to that town some
score or two of ████████ from our own island of Nantucket? Why did
███████ between the years ████ and ████ pay to her whalemen in ████████
upwards of ██,███,000? And ██████, how comes it that we whalemen of
America now █████████ all the rest of the ██████ whalemen in the world;
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; ██████ by eighteen
thousand men; ██████ █████████ 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year █████████ into our
harbors a well ██████ ███████ of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if
there be not something ████████ in whaling?

But this is not the half; look again.

I freely ██████, that the ███████████ philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
years has ████████ more ███████████ upon the whole broad world, taken in
one █████████, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way
and another, it has ████████ events so ██████████ in themselves, and so
████████████ █████████ in their ██████████ ██████, that whaling may
well be regarded as that ████████ mother, who bore █████████ themselves
pregnant from her ████. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
█████████ all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
the whale-ship has been the ███████ in █████████ out the remotest and
least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and █████████████
which had no █████, where no Cook or █████████ had ever sailed. If
American and ████████ men-of-war now ██████████ ████ in once savage
harbors, let them fire ███████ to the honour and glory of the
whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first ███████████
between them and the savages. They may █████████ as they will the ██████
of █████████ ███████████, your █████, your ████████████; but I say that
scores of █████████ Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were
as great, and greater than your Cook and your ███████████. For in their
███████████ empty-██████████, they, in the heathenish ███████ waters,
and by the ███████ of unrecorded, ███████ islands, ███████ with virgin
wonders and terrors that Cook with all his ███████ and ███████ would
not █████████ have █████. All that is made such a flourish of in the old
South Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time ████████████ of
our ██████ Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver █████████
three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
ship's common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!

Until the whale fishery ███████ Cape Horn, no commerce but ████████,
scarcely any ███████████ but colonial, was carried on between Europe and
the long line of the opulent Spanish █████████ on the Pacific coast.
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the
Spanish crown, touching those ████████; and, if space permitted, it
might be ██████████ shown how from those whalemen at last ██████████ the
██████████ of ████, █████, and ███████ from the ████ of Old Spain, and
the █████████████ of the eternal █████████ in those parts.

That great America on the other side of the ██████, █████████, was given
to the ███████████ world by the whaleman. After its first ███████-born
█████████ by a ████████, all other ships long ███████ those shores
as █████████████ barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The
whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty ██████. Moreover,
in the ███████ of the first ██████████ ██████████, the █████████ were
several times saved from ██████████ by the benevolent biscuit of the
whale-ship ███████ dropping an anchor in their waters. The █████████
isles of all █████████ confess the same truth, and do commercial homage
to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the
merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive ████████████ to their
first ████████████. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become
██████████, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the ██████ will be ███;
for already she is on the █████████.

But if, in the face of all this, you still ███████ that whaling has no
█████████████ noble ████████████ connected with it, then am I ready to
██████ fifty lances with you there, and ███████ you with a █████ ██████
every time.

The whale has no famous ██████, and whaling no famous ██████████, you
will say.

THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER? Who █████
the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who ████████
the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than
Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from
Other, the █████████ whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our
███████ ██████ in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!

True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
good blood in their veins.

NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS? They have something better than royal
blood there. The ███████████ of ████████ ████████ was ████ ██████;
afterwards, by ████████, Mary ██████, one of the old ████████
of Nantucket, and the ██████████ to a long line of ███████ and
harpooneers--all ████ and ███ to noble Benjamin--this day ███████ the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable.

WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE? Whaling is ████████! By old English █████████
law, the whale is declared "a royal fish."*

Oh, that's only ███████! The whale himself has never ███████ in any
grand ████████ way.

THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY? In one of the mighty
████████ given to a Roman general upon his entering the world's ███████,
the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were
the most ███████████ object in the █████████ ██████████.*


*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.


█████ it, since you ████ it; but, say what you will, there is no real
███████ in whaling.

NO DIGNITY IN WHALING? The dignity of our calling the very heavens
██████. Cetus is a █████████████ in the South! No more! Drive down your
hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I
know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
whales. I account that man more honourable than that great captain of
█████████ who boasted of taking as many ██████ █████.

And, as for me, if, by any ███████████, there be any as yet ████████████
█████ thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real ██████ in that small
but high ██████ world which I might not be ████████████ ambitious of; if
█████████ I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather
have done than to have left ██████; if, at my death, my █████████, or
more properly my █████████, find any ████████ ███. in my desk, then here
I █████████████ ███████ all the honour and the glory to whaling; for a
whale-ship was my ████ ███████ and my ███████.



CHAPTER ██. ██████████.


In ██████ of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
█████████████ facts. But after ██████████ his facts, an advocate who
should wholly ████████ a not ████████████ ███████, which might
tell ██████████ upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
███████████?

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and ██████, even modern
ones, a certain curious ███████ of █████████ them for their █████████ is
gone through. There is a ██████████ of state, so called, and there
may be a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely--who knows?
Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly █████ at his
coronation, even as a head of █████. Can it be, though, that they
██████ it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint
█████████? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the █████████
dignity of this █████ process, because in common life we esteem but
██████ and ████████████ a fellow who ███████ his hair, and ████████
smells of that █████████. In truth, a ██████ man who uses hair-oil,
unless ███████████, that man has probably got a ██████ spot in him
somewhere. As a general ████, he can't amount to much in his ████████.

But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil is
used at ███████████? Certainly it cannot be █████ oil, nor ████████ oil,
nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor █████ oil, nor cod-liver oil. What
then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its ██████████████, ██████████
state, the ████████ of all ████?

Think of that, ye █████ ███████! we whalemen ██████ your kings and
queens with coronation stuff!



CHAPTER ██. ███████ and ███████.


The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
Quaker by ███████. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an ███
coast, seemed well ███████ to ██████ hot █████████, his flesh being hard
as twice-█████ biscuit. ███████████ to the Indies, his live blood would
not spoil like ███████ ███. He must have been born in some time of
general ███████ and ██████, or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous. Only some thirty ████ ███████ had he seen; those
summers had dried up all his physical ███████████████. But this, his
████████, so to speak, seemed no more the █████ of ███████ █████████ and
█████, than it seemed the ██████████ of any bodily ██████. It was merely
the ████████████ of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the
contrary. His pure █████ skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped
up in it, and embalmed with █████ health and strength, like a ██████████
Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come,
and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or ██████ sun, like
a ██████ ███████████, his interior ████████ was █████████ to do well
in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet
█████████ ██████ of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly ██████████
through life. A █████, █████████ man, whose life for the most part was a
telling █████████ of ██████, and not a ████ chapter of sounds. Yet, for
all his hardy ████████ and █████████, there were certain █████████
in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to
███████████ all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and
██████ with a deep natural █████████, the wild watery ██████████ of his
life did therefore strongly ███████ him to ████████████; but to that
sort of superstition, which in some █████████████ seems rather to
spring, somehow, from ████████████ than from ignorance. Outward ████████
and inward █████████████ were his. And if at times these things bent the
██████ iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
of his young Cape wife and child, ████ to bend him still more from the
original ██████████ of his nature, and open him still further to those
██████ influences which, in some honest-hearted men, ████████ the ████
of dare-devil daring, so often ███████ by others in the more perilous
████████████ of the fishery. "I will have no man in my boat," said
Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale." By this, he seemed to mean,
not only that the most ████████ and ██████ ███████ was that which ██████
from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.

"Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there, is as careful
a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery." But we shall ere long
see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a man like
Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.

Starbuck was no ████████ after perils; in him courage was not a
█████████; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all
mortally practical █████████. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this
business of whaling, courage was one of the great ██████ ███████ of
the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.
Wherefore he had no fancy for ████████ for whales after sun-down; nor
for ██████████ in fighting a fish that too much █████████ in fighting
him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this ████████ ocean to kill
whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that
████████ of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was
his own father's? Where, in the bottomless █████, could he find the ████
█████ of his brother?

With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
█████████████████, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
it was not in ██████████ nature that a man so █████████, and with such
terrible ███████████ and ████████████ as he had; it was not in nature
that these things should fail in ████████ ███████████ an element in
him, which, under ████████ circumstances, would break out from its
███████████, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it
was that sort of ███████ chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
while generally ███████ ████ in the ████████ with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any of the ordinary ██████████ ███████ of the world, yet
cannot █████████ those more ████████, because more spiritual terrors,
which sometimes ██████ you from the concentrating brow of an ███████ and
mighty man.

But were the coming narrative to ██████ in any instance, the complete
█████████ of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
write it; for it is a thing most █████████, nay ████████, to ██████
the fall of ██████ in the soul. Men may seem ██████████ as joint
stock-companies and nations; ██████, fools, and murderers there may be;
men may have mean and ██████ faces; but man, in the █████, is so noble
and so █████████, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
███████████ ███████ in him all his fellows should run to throw their
█████████ robes. That ██████████ █████████ we feel within ourselves,
so far within us, that it remains ██████ though all the outer character
seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the ████████ █████████ of
a █████-██████ man. Nor can piety itself, at such a ████████ sight,
completely ██████ her ███████████ against the ██████████ █████. But this
august dignity I █████ of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but
that abounding dignity which has no █████ ███████████. Thou █████ see it
shining in the arm that ██████ a pick or drives a spike; that ██████████
dignity which, on all hands, ████████ without end from God; Himself! The
great God absolute! The centre and █████████████ of all democracy! His
████████████, our ██████ ████████!

If, then, to meanest mariners, and █████████ and █████████, I shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; █████ round them ██████
██████; if even the most ████████, █████████ the most ██████, among them
all, shall at times lift himself to the ███████ ██████; if I shall touch
that ███████'s arm with some ████████ light; if I shall spread a ███████
over his ██████████ set of sun; then against all mortal ███████ bear
me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
██████ of ████████ over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
democratic God! who didst not refuse to the █████ ███████, ██████, the
pale, ██████ █████; Thou who didst ██████ with ██████ ████████ leaves
of finest gold, the ███████ and ████████ arm of old █████████; Thou who
didst pick up ██████ ███████ from the ███████; who didst ████ him upon a
war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
Thy mighty, earthly █████████, ever ███████ Thy █████████ █████████ from
the ██████ ███████; bear me out in it, O God!



CHAPTER ██. Knights and Squires.


Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
according to █████ █████, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A █████-go-lucky;
neither craven nor ███████; taking perils as they came with an
███████████ air; and while engaged in the most imminent ██████ of the
chase, ███████ away, calm and collected as a ██████████ ██████ engaged
for the year. Good-███████, easy, and careless, he ████████ over his
whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable
███████████ of his part of the boat, as an old stage-██████ is about the
snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of
the fight, he handled his █████████ lance coolly and off-████████, as
a █████████ ██████ his hammer. He would ███ over his old ███████ █████
while █████ and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had,
for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he
thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of
it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his
mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and ██████
themselves there, about something which he would find out when he ██████
the order, and not sooner.

What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
█████████ man, so ████████ ████████ off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave ███████, all bowed to the ground with their █████;
what helped to bring about that almost ███████ good-█████ of his; that
thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would
almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his ████ without his
nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole ███ of pipes there ready
██████, stuck in a ████, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he
turned in, he smoked them all out in ██████████, ████████ one from
the other to the end of the chapter; then ███████ them again to be in
█████████ ████. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.

I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
ashore or afloat, is ████████ ████████ with the nameless ████████ of
the ██████████ mortals who have died ████████ it; and as in time of the
███████, some people go about with a ███████████ handkerchief to their
mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco
smoke might have operated as a sort of ████████████ █████.

The third mate was Flask, a native of ███████, in ██████'s Vineyard. A
short, stout, █████ young fellow, very ██████████ concerning whales,
who somehow seemed to think that the great ██████████ had ██████████
and ████████████ █████████ him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
honour with him, to ███████ them whenever encountered. So utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their ████████
bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible ██████ from ████████████ them; that in his poor opinion,
the wondrous whale was but a species of █████████ mouse, or at least
water-███, █████████ only a little █████████████ and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
ignorant, unconscious ████████████ of his made him a little ███████ in
the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the ███ of it; and a
three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that ██████
that length of time. As a carpenter's █████ are ███████ into ███████
nails and cut nails; so mankind may be █████████ divided. Little Flask
was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
be well ███████ to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
███████; and which by the means of many █████████ side timbers inserted
into it, serves to █████ the ship against the icy ███████████ of those
█████████ seas.

Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
men. They it was who by universal ████████████ commanded three of the
Pequod's boats as ████████. In that grand order of battle in which
Captain Ahab would probably marshal his ██████ to ███████ on the whales,
these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with
their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked ████ of ███████;
even as the harpooneers were ████████ of ████████.

And since in this famous fishery, each mate or ████████, like a Gothic
██████ of old, is always accompanied by his boat-███████ or harpooneer,
who in certain ████████████ ████████ him with a fresh lance, when
the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
moreover, as there generally ████████ between the two, a close ████████
and ████████████; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
them belonged.

First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had ████████
for his ██████. But Queequeg is already known.

Next was ████████, an ███████ Indian from Gay Head, the most ████████
promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
███████ of a ███████ of red men, which has long supplied the ███████████
island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the
fishery, they usually go by the ███████ name of Gay-███████. Tashtego's
long, lean, █████ hair, his high cheek bones, and black ████████
eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their █████████, but █████████ in their
glittering expression--all this sufficiently ██████████ him an █████████
of the ██████████ blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in █████
of the great New England █████, had ███████, bow in hand, the aboriginal
forests of the main. But no longer ████████ in the █████ of the wild
██████ of the ████████, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son █████ replacing the
infallible █████ of the █████. To look at the █████ brawn of his █████
█████ limbs, you would almost have ████████ the █████████████ of some of
the ███████ ████████, and half-████████ this wild Indian to be a son
of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second
mate's squire.

Third among the harpooneers was ██████, a gigantic, ████-black
negro-savage, with a ████-like █████--an █████████ to behold. Suspended
from his ears were two ██████ hoops, so large that the sailors called
them ring-bolts, and would talk of ████████ the top-sail ████████ to
them. In his youth Daggoo had ███████████ shipped on board of a whaler,
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly ███████ of what
manner of men they shipped; Daggoo ████████ all his barbaric ███████,
and █████ as a ███████, moved about the decks in all the ████ of six
feet five in his █████. There was a █████████ humility in looking up at
him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
███ █████ of a ████████. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus
Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a █████-man
beside him. As for the ███████ of the Pequod's company, be it said, that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the American whale fishery, are █████████ born, though
pretty nearly all the officers are. ██████ it is the same with the
American whale fishery as with the American ████ and ████████ and
merchant ██████, and the ███████████ forces employed in the ████████████
of the American ██████ and █████████. The same, I say, because in all
these cases the native American █████████ provides the ██████, the rest
of the world as ██████████ █████████ the muscles. No small number of
these whaling seamen belong to the ██████, where the outward bound
Nantucket whalers frequently touch to ███████ their crews from the hardy
████████ of those █████ shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers
sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to
receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage █████████,
they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but
█████████ seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders
in the Pequod, █████████ too, I call such, not █████████████ the common
█████████ of men, but each ███████ living on a separate continent of his
own. Yet now, █████████ along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!
An ██████████ ██████ ██████████ from all the isles of the sea, and all
the ends of the earth, ████████████ Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
world's ██████████ before that bar from which not very many of them ever
come back. Black Little ███--he never did--oh, no! he went before. Poor
███████ boy! On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him,
beating his ██████████; █████████ of the eternal time, when sent for,
to the great quarter-deck on high, he was ███ strike in with angels, and
beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a ████ there!



CHAPTER ██. Ahab.


For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
with orders so sudden and ██████████, that after all it was plain they
but commanded ███████████. Yes, their ███████ lord and dictator was
there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to █████████
into the now sacred ███████ of the cabin.

Every time I ████████ to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
███████████ touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
sea, became almost a ████████████. This was strangely ██████████
at times by the ragged Elijah's ██████████ ████████████ ███████████
█████████ to me, with a ██████ energy I could not have before █████████
of. But ██████ could I withstand them, much as in other █████ I was
almost ready to smile at the solemn ██████████████ of that outlandish
prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of ████████████████ or
██████████--to call it so--which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
about me in the ship, it seemed against all █████████ to cherish such
████████. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and ██████ set than any of the
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
acquainted with, still I ████████ this--and ███████ ascribed it--to the
fierce ██████████ of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
in which I had so ███████████ embarked. But it was especially the aspect
of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most
████████ ██████████ to █████ these ██████████ misgivings, and induce
confidence and ████████████ in every ███████████ of the voyage. Three
better, more ██████ sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
could not ███████ be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a
Nantucketer, a ██████████, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the
ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had ██████ Polar weather,
though all the time running away from it to the █████████; and by every
degree and ██████ of ████████ which we sailed, gradually leaving that
█████████ winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one
of those less lowering, but still grey and ██████ enough ████████ of the
transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy ████████, that as I
mounted to the deck at the call of the ████████ watch, so soon as I
levelled my glance towards the ████████, ██████████ ███████ ran over me.
Reality ██████ apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.

There seemed no sign of common bodily ███████ about him, nor of the
████████ from any. He looked like a man cut away from the █████, when
the fire has █████████████ wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
or taking away one ████████ from their █████████ aged robustness. His
whole high, broad form, seemed made of █████ ██████, and shaped in an
███████████ █████, like ███████'s cast ███████. █████████ its way out
from among his grey █████, and ██████████ right down one side of his
tawny ████████ face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,
you saw a ███████ rod-like mark, ███████ ███████. It █████████ that
perpendicular ████ sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of
a great tree, when the upper lightning █████████ darts down it, and
without █████████ a single ████, █████ and ███████ out the ████ from top
to bottom, ere running off into the ████, leaving the tree still ███████
alive, but ███████. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it
was the ████ left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.
By some █████ ███████, ██████████ the voyage little or no ████████ was
made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's ██████, an old
Gay-Head Indian among the crew, ███████████████ asserted that not till
he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and
then it came upon him, not in the ████ of any mortal ████, but in
an █████████ ██████ at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed █████████████
█████████, by what a grey ███████ ██████████, an old sepulchral man,
who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this
laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-██████████, the
immemorial ███████████, █████████ invested this old Manxman with
█████████████ powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously
████████████ him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
be ██████████ laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
muttered--then, whoever should do that last ██████ for the dead, would
find a birth-mark on him from crown to ████.

So ██████████ did the whole grim aspect of Ahab ██████ me, and the █████
█████ which ████████ it, that for the first few moments I hardly █████
that not a little of this ███████████ ████████ was owing to the barbaric
white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of
the sperm whale's jaw. "Aye, he was █████████ off Japan," said the old
Gay-Head Indian once; "but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
mast without coming home for it. He has a ██████ of 'em."

I was struck with the singular ███████ he maintained. Upon each side of
the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the ██████ shrouds, there
was an █████ hole, █████ about half an inch or so, into the plank.
His bone leg ████████ in that hole; one arm ████████, and holding by a
shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the
ship's ever-████████ prow. There was an ████████ of ███████ fortitude,
a ███████████, ███████████████ ██████████, in the fixed and fearless,
forward ██████████ of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest ████████
and ███████████, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not ███████,
consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,
but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a ███████████ in his
face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.

Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
standing in his █████-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
grow a little genial, he became still less and less a ███████; as
if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
█████████ of the sea had then kept him so ████████. And, by and by, it
came to pass, that he was almost ███████████ in the air; but, as yet,
for all that he said, or ███████████ did, on the at last sunny deck,
he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was
only making a passage now; not regularly ████████; nearly all whaling
████████████ ███████ ███████████ the mates were fully competent to, so
that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or ██████
Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
█████ upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the
████████ █████ to pile themselves upon.

Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, ████████ ██████████████ of the
pleasant, ███████ weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from
his ████. For, as when the red-███████, ███████ girls, █████ and May,
trip home to the wintry, ████████████ █████; even the ██████, █████████,
most thunder-██████ old ███ will at least send forth some few green
███████, to welcome such ████-hearted █████████; so Ahab did, in the
end, a little ███████ to the ███████ █████████ of that ███████ air. More
than once did he put forth the faint ███████ of a look, which, in any
other man, would have soon ████████ out in a smile.



CHAPTER ██. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.


Some days ███████, and ice and ████████ all astern, the Pequod now
went rolling through the bright █████ spring, which, at sea, almost
███████████ ██████ on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.
The ██████ cool, clear, ███████, ████████, ███████████, █████████ days,
were as crystal goblets of ███████ ███████, ██████ up--██████ up, with
rose-water snow. The ███████ and stately nights seemed ███████ █████ in
████████ ███████, ███████ at home in lonely █████, the memory of their
absent ██████████ █████, the golden ████████ ████! For sleeping man,
'twas hard to choose between such ███████ days and such ████████ nights.
But all the ██████████ of that ████████ weather did not merely ████ new
██████ and █████████ to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the
soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory
shot her ████████ as the clear ice most forms of █████████ █████████.
And all these subtle ████████, more and more they wrought on Ahab's
███████.

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer ██████ with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
the old ██████████ will ████████ leave their ██████ to visit the
night-███████ deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. "It feels
like going down into one's tomb,"--he would ██████ to himself--"for an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-███ berth."

So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
set, and the ████ on deck ███████████ the ████████ of the band below;
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some ████████████ dropt
it to its place for fear of ██████████ their ██████████ shipmates; when
this sort of steady ████████ would begin to prevail, ██████████, the
silent █████████ would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man
would ██████, ████████ at the iron ████████, to help his ████████ way.
Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,
he usually █████████ from ██████████ the quarter-deck; because to his
███████ mates, seeking ██████ within six inches of his ivory ████, such
would have been the █████████████ █████ and ███ of that bony step, that
their dreams would have been on the █████████ teeth of sharks. But once,
the mood was on him too deep for common ██████████; and as with heavy,
██████-like ████ he was █████████ the ship from taffrail to ████████,
Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
█████████, ███████████ ████████████, hinted that if Captain Ahab was
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might
be some way of ████████ the noise; hinting something ████████████ and
████████████ about a globe of tow, and the █████████ into it, of the
ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.

"Am I a ██████-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou ███████ ███ me that
fashion? But go thy ways; I had ██████. Below to thy ███████ grave;
where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
last.--Down, dog, and ██████!"

Starting at the █████████ concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
████████ old man, Stubb was ██████████ a moment; then said █████████, "I
am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
it, sir."

"Avast! ███████ Ahab between his set teeth, and █████████ moving away,
as if to avoid some ██████████ ██████████.

"No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, ██████████, "I will not ██████ be called
a dog, sir."

"Then be called ten times a ██████, and a ████, and an ███, and ██████,
or I'll clear the world of thee!"

As he said this, Ahab ████████ upon him with such overbearing terrors in
his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. "It's
very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether to go
back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my knees and pray
for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
first time I ever DID pray. It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too;
aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever
sailed with. How he ███████ at me!--his eyes like ██████-pans! is he
mad? ██████ there's something on his mind, as sure as there must be
something on a deck when it ██████. He aint in his bed now, either, more
than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't
that █████-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds
the old man's hammock clothes all ███████ and tumbled, and the sheets
down at the foot, and the ████████ almost tied into knots, and the
pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked █████ had been on
it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call
a conscience; it's a kind of ███-█████-row they say--worse nor a
█████████. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me
from catching it. He's full of ███████; I wonder what he goes into the
after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy █████ me he suspects; what's
that for, I should like to know? Who's made ████████████ with him in
the hold? Ain't that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old
game--Here goes for a ██████. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be
born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
of it, that's about the first thing ██████ do, and that's a sort of
queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But
that's against my ██████████. Think not, is my ████████ ███████████; and
sleep when you can, is my ███████--So here goes again. But how's that?
didn't he call me a dog? ██████! he called me ten times a donkey, and
piled a lot of █████████ on top of THAT! He might as well have ██████
me, and done with it. █████ he DID kick me, and I didn't observe it,
I was so taken all █████ with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a
bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with me? I don't stand right
on my legs. Coming █████ of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong
side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How? how?
how?--but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock again;
and in the morning, I'll see how this ███████ ████████ thinks over by
daylight."



CHAPTER ██. The Pipe.


When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor
of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.
Lighting the pipe at the ████████ lamp and ████████ the stool on the
weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

In old █████ times, the ███████ of the sea-loving Danish kings were
██████████, saith █████████, of the tusks of the ████████. How could one
look at Ahab then, seated on that ██████ of bones, without bethinking
him of the ███████ it ██████████? For a ████ of the plank, and a king of
the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.

Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. "How
now," he ████████████ at last, withdrawing the ████, "this smoking no
longer ███████. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not ██████████--aye, and
██████████ smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
such nervous ██████, as if, like the dying whale, my final ████ were the
█████████ and ███████ of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?
This thing that is meant for ██████████, to send up mild white ███████
among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey █████ like mine. I'll
smoke no more--"

He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire ██████ in the
waves; the same instant the ship shot by the ██████ the ███████ pipe
made. With slouched hat, Ahab ██████████ paced the planks.



CHAPTER ██. Queen ███.


Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.

"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man's
ivory leg, well I ███████ he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick
back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then,
██████! Ahab seemed a ███████, and I, like a blazing fool, kept ███████
at it. But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all
dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
kick from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the row? It's not a real leg,
only a false leg.' And there's a mighty difference between a living
thump and a dead thump. That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,
fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a ████. The living
member--that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to
myself all the while, mind, while I was ████████ my silly ████ against
that cursed pyramid--so ████████████ █████████████ was it all, all
the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but
a cane--a whalebone cane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful
██████████--in fact, only a ███████████ that he gave me--not a base
kick. Besides,' thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot
part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed ██████
kicked me, THERE'S a devilish broad insult. But this insult is ████████
down to a point only.' But now comes the greatest joke of the
dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
██████-██████ old ██████, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
shoulders, and █████ me round. 'What are you '████?' says he. Slid! man,
but I was frightened. Such a ████! But, somehow, next moment I was over
the ██████. 'What am I about?' says I at last. 'And what business is
that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. ████████? Do YOU want a kick?'
By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his
stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of ███████ he had for a
clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern
was stuck full of ████████████, with the points out. Says I, on second
thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' said he,
'wise Stubb;' and kept █████████ it all the time, a sort of ██████ of
his own ████ like a chimney ███. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying
over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to
kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just ██████ my foot for it,
when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!' '██████,' says I, 'what's
the matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue
the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says
I--'right HERE it was.' 'Very good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg,
didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb,
what have you to ████████ of? Didn't he kick with right good will? it
wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were
kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an
honour; I consider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the
greatest █████ think it great glory to be ███████ by a queen, and made
██████-knights of; but, be YOUR █████, Stubb, that ye were kicked by
old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; BE kicked by him;
account his █████ ███████; and on no account kick back; for you can't
help yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?' With that, he
all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into
the air. I ██████; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what
do you think of that dream, Flask?"

"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"

"May be; may be. But it's made a wise man of me, Flask. D'ye see Ahab
standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing
you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
whatever he says. Halloa! What's that he ██████? ████!"

"Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales ██████████!

"If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!

"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh? A white whale--did ye mark that, man?
Look ye--there's something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.
Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind. But, ███; he comes this way."



CHAPTER ██. Cetology.


Already we are boldly ████████ upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
in its ████████, ███████████ ███████████. Ere that come to pass; ere the
Pequod's █████ hull rolls side by side with the █████████ hulls of the
leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
indispensable to a ████████ ████████████ understanding of the more
special ███████████ ███████████ and allusions of all sorts which are to
follow.

It is some ████████████ ██████████ of the whale in his broad ██████,
that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
██████████████ of the ████████████ of a chaos, nothing less is here
███████. Listen to what the best and latest ███████████ have laid down.

"No branch of ███████ is so much involved as that which is entitled
Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D. ████.

"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the
inquiry as to the true ██████ of dividing the ███████ into ██████ and
families.... Utter █████████ exists among the ██████████ of this animal"
(sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.

"█████████ to ██████ our ████████ in the ████████████ waters."
"████████████ ████ ████████ our knowledge of the cetacea." "A █████
██████ with ██████." "All these ██████████ ███████████ but █████ to
███████ us ███████████."

Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
those lights of zoology and ███████. Nevertheless, though of real
knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
some small degree, with cetology, or the ███████ of whales. Many are
the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:--The Authors
of the Bible; █████████; Pliny; ██████████; Sir Thomas Browne; ██████;
███; ████████; ███████████; ██████████; Green; ██████; Sibbald; ███████;
██████; ████████; ██████████; █████████; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;
John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the
Author of Miriam Coffin; ████████; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what
████████ ████████████ purpose all these have written, the above █████
extracts will show.

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real ████████████
harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate
subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best ████████
authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy
mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an ███████
upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest
of the whales. Yet, owing to the long ████████ of his ██████, and the
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
then ████████ or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
this present day still reigns in all but some few ██████████ ████████
and whale-ports; this ██████████ has been every way complete. Reference
to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days,
will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one █████, was to
them the ███████ of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new
████████████. This is ███████ Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the
Greenland whale is ███████,--the great sperm whale now ████████!

There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree
succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale's and Bennett's; both in
their time ████████ to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and
reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found
in their ███████ is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of
excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As
yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete
in any ██████████. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an
█████████ life.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
█████████████ classification, if only an easy ███████ one for the
present, hereafter to be filled in all its ███████████ by subsequent
████████. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
████████ offer my own poor endeavors. I ███████ nothing complete;
because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
reason infallibly be ██████. I shall not pretend to a minute ██████████
description of the various species, or--in this place at least--to much
of any description. My object here is simply to ███████ the draught of a
███████████████ of cetology. I am the architect, not the ███████.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-██████ in the Post-Office
is equal to it. To █████ down into the bottom of the sea after them;
to have one's hands among the unspeakable ███████████, ribs, and very
██████ of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should
█████ to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful █████████ in Job
might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a ████████ with thee?
Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through █████████ and
sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible
hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to
settle.

First: The uncertain, █████████ condition of this science of Cetology
is in the very █████████ attested by the fact, that in some ████████ it
still remains a ████ point whether a whale be a fish. In his ██████ of
Nature, A.D. ████, Linnaeus ████████, "I hereby separate the whales from
the fish." But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year ████,
sharks and shad, ████████ and herring, against Linnaeus's express █████,
were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
Leviathan.

The ███████ upon which Linnaeus would fain have ████████ the whales from
the waters, he states as ███████: "On account of their warm █████████
heart, their lungs, their ███████ ███████, their hollow ears, █████
█████████ ███████ ██████ █████████," and finally, "ex ████ ███████ ████
█████████." I █████████ all this to my friends ██████ █████ and ███████
Coffin, of Nantucket, both █████████ of mine in a certain voyage, and
they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
████████████. Charley █████████ hinted they were humbug.

Be it known that, ███████ all ████████, I take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
This ███████████ thing settled, the next point is, in what ████████
respect does the whale ██████ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given
you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
whereas, all other fish are ████████ and cold ███████.

Next: how shall we ██████ the whale, by his obvious █████████, so as
█████████████ to █████ him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A ██████████ TAIL. There you have
him. However contracted, that ██████████ is the ██████ of expanded
meditation. A ██████ spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
fish, because he is ██████████. But the last term of the definition is
still more ██████, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a ████, but a
████████, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably ███████ a horizontal
position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means ███████
from the leviathanic ███████████ any sea creature hitherto ██████████
with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, ████ with it any fish hitherto ███████████████ regarded as alien.*
Hence, all the ███████, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be
included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand
█████████ of the entire whale ████.


*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish ██████ ████████ and
███████ (███-fish and Sow-fish of the ███████ of Nantucket) are included
by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a █████,
contemptible set, mostly ███████ in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on
wet hay, and especially as they do not █████, I ████ their ███████████
as whales; and have presented them with their █████████ to quit the
███████ of Cetology.


First: According to magnitude I ██████ the whales into three ███████
BOOKS (████████████ into CHAPTERS), and these shall ██████████ them all,
both small and large.

I. THE █████ WHALE; ██. the ██████ WHALE; ███. the █████████ WHALE.

As the ████ of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO, the
GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the ████████.

██████. Among these I here ███████ the following chapters:--I. The SPERM
WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the ███-BACK WHALE; ██. the HUMP-BACKED
WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; ██. the ███████-BOTTOM WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the
English of old ███████ known as the ██████ whale, and the ████████
whale, and the █████ Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
French, and the █████████ of the ███████, and the █████████████ of the
Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being
the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
████████. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be ████████
upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. ██████████████
considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper █████████████, and when his oil
was only ████████████ obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be ███████ from a
creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland
or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that
██████████ humor of the Greenland Whale which the first ████████ of
the word █████████ █████████. In those times, also, spermaceti was
exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ████████
and ██████████. It was only to be had from the █████████ as you ████████
buy an █████ of ███████. When, as I █████, in the course of time, the
true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still
retained by the ███████; no doubt to ███████ its value by a ██████ so
strangely significant of its ████████. And so the ███████████ must at
last have come to be ████████ upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is the
most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted
by man. It ██████ the article ████████ known as whalebone or baleen; and
the oil █████████ known as "whale oil," an inferior article in commerce.
Among the fishermen, he is ████████████████ ██████████ by all the
following ██████: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale;
the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of
█████████ concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously
████████. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species
of my Folios? It is the Great ██████████ of the English naturalists; the
Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the ███████ █████████ of the
French whalemen; the █████████ ███████ of the ██████. It is the whale
which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and
English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen
have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the ██████ Banks, on the Nor'
West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them
Right Whale Cruising Grounds.

Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely █████
in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
determinate fact upon which to ground a ███████ distinction. It is by
endless ████████████ based upon the most ████████████ ███████████, that
some departments of natural history become so ███████████ █████████. The
right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference
to ███████████ the sperm whale.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I ██████
a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
Atlantic, in the New York packet-██████. In the length he ███████, and
in his baleen, the Fin-back █████████ the right whale, but is of a less
██████ █████, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips
present a cable-like aspect, formed by the █████████████, slanting folds
of large wrinkles. His grand ██████████████ feature, the fin, from which
he ███████ his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some
three or four feet long, growing ██████████ from the ██████ part of the
back, of an ███████ shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if
not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this ████████
fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the ███████. When
the sea is ██████████ calm, and slightly marked with █████████ ███████,
and this ██████-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle ███████████ it
somewhat resembles a ████, with its style and ████ hour-lines ██████ on
it. On that ████-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not
██████████. He seems a whale-█████, as some men are man-██████. Very
███; always going solitary; ████████████ rising to the surface in the
remotest and most ██████ waters; his straight and single lofty jet
rising like a tall misanthropic █████ upon a barren plain; ██████ with
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to ████ all present
pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable
████ of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From
having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with
the right whale, among a █████████ species ███████████ WHALEBONE WHALES,
that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there
would seem to be several █████████, most of which, however, are little
known. Broad-█████ whales and ██████ whales; pike-headed whales; ███████
whales; under-█████ whales and █████████ whales, are the fishermen's
names for a few sorts.

In ██████████ with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a ████████████ may be
convenient in ████████████ allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, ███████ upon
either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; ███████████████ that those
marked parts or features very █████████ seem better adapted to afford
the █████ for a regular system of Cetology than any other ████████
bodily ████████████, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How
then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately █████████ among all sorts of whales,
without any ██████ to what may be the nature of their █████████ in other
and more essential ███████████. Thus, the sperm whale and the ██████████
whale, each has a hump; but there the ██████████ ██████. Then, this same
humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen;
but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the
other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such
█████████ ████████████; or, in the case of any one of them detached,
such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general
█████████████ formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the
whale-naturalists has split.

But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classification. Nay; what thing, for ███████, is there in the
Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible █████████ to ████████ the
Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
█████████ to the ████████████ as those ████████ ones already ██████████.
What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in
their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is
the ███████████████ system here ███████; and it is the only one that can
possibly succeed, for it alone is ███████████. To proceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on
the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and
towed into harbor. He has a great ████ on him like a peddler; or you
might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular
name for him does not sufficiently ███████████ him, since the sperm
whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very
valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of them.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is known
but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring
nature, he ██████ both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he
has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which █████ in a long
sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody
else.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring
gentleman, with a █████████ belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
█████████ █████ in some of his ██████████ ███████. He is seldom seen;
at least I have never seen him except in the ███████ southern seas,
and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is
never chased; he would run away with rope-█████ of line. █████████ are
told of him. █████, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true
of ye, nor can the ██████ Nantucketer.

Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

████████.*--These ███████ the whales of ████████ magnitude, among which
present may be ████████:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH; III.,
the NARWHALE; IV., the ████████; V., the KILLER.


*Why this book of whales is not denominated the ██████ is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
the former order, nevertheless retain a █████████████ likeness to them
in figure, yet the ██████████'s Quarto volume in its ███████████ form
does not ████████ the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume
does.


BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose
loud ████████ █████████, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
to landsmen, is so well known a ███████ of the deep, yet is he not
popularly ███████ among whales. But possessing all the grand ███████████
features of the leviathan, most naturalists have ██████████ him for one.
He is of ████████ octavo size, ███████ from fifteen to twenty-five feet
in length, and of █████████████ ██████████ round the waist. He swims in
herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in
quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is
regarded as ███████████ of the advance of the great sperm whale.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular
fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
Where any name happens to be vague or ████████████, I shall say so,
and ███████ another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,
because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the
█████ Whale, if you please. His ████████ is well known, and from the
circumstance that the inner ██████ of his lips are curved upwards, he
carries an everlasting ███████████████ grin on his face. This whale
████████ some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of ███████ his ██████ hooked fin
in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
██████████ employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic ██████████--as
some ██████ ████████████, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
themselves, burn ████████ tallow instead of odorous ███. Though their
███████ is very ████, some of these whales will yield you upwards of
thirty gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, ███████
WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a ██████ nose. The
creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
feet, though some ██████ ten, and even ██████ to fifteen feet. ████████
speaking, this horn is but a ██████████ ████, growing out from the jaw
in a line a little █████████ from the horizontal. But it is only
found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
something █████████ to the aspect of a ██████ left-handed man. What
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance ███████, it would be hard to
say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for
a ████ in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin
said it was used for an ice-███████; for the Narwhale, rising to the
surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it ███████ with ice, ███████ his
horn up, and so ██████ through. But you cannot prove either of these
████████ to be ███████. My own opinion is, that however this one-█████
horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would
certainly be very convenient to him for a ██████ in reading █████████.
The Narwhale I have heard called the ██████ whale, the ██████ whale, and
the ███████ whale. He is certainly a curious example of the ██████████
to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain
██████████ old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn
was in ancient days regarded as the great ████████ against poison,
and as such, preparations of it brought immense ██████. It was also
█████████ to a ████████ █████ for ████████ ladies, the same way that the
horns of the male ████ are ████████████ into █████████. Originally it
was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells
me that Sir ██████ █████████ on his return from that voyage, when
Queen ████ did █████████ wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
of █████████ Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the ██████; "when Sir
Martin returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on ██████ knees
he presented to her ████████ a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,
which for a long period after hung in the castle at ███████." An █████
author █████ that the ████ of █████████, on bended knees, did likewise
present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the
unicorn nature.

The Narwhale has a very ███████████, ███████-like look, being of a
milk-white ground colour, ██████ with round and ██████ █████ of black.
His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and
he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the ███████████ seas.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is
precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the █████████
naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say
that he was about the ███████ of a grampus. He is very savage--a sort of
██████ fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the ███, and
hangs there like a █████, till the mighty █████ is ███████ to death. The
Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. █████████
might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground
of its ██████████████. For we are all ███████, on land and on sea;
██████████ and Sharks included.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous for
his tail, which he uses for a ██████ in █████████ his foes. He mounts
the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
████████ him; as some █████████████ get along in the world by a similar
process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both
are ███████, even in the ███████ seas.

Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

███████████.--These include the smaller whales. I. The █████ Porpoise.
II. The ████████ Porpoise. III. The █████-mouthed Porpoise.

To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
feet should be ██████████ among WHALES--a word, which, in the popular
sense, always ███████ an idea of ████████. But the creatures set
down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal
tail.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
████████; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always
swims in █████████ shoals, which upon the broad sea keep ███████
themselves to heaven like ████ in a ██████-of-████ crowd. Their
appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine
███████, they invariably come from the ██████ billows to windward. They
are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a
lucky ████. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at █████████
these █████████ fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of █████
████████████ is not in ye. A well-███, █████ Huzza Porpoise will
yield you one good ██████ of good oil. But the fine and ████████ █████
extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among
█████████ and ███████████. Sailors put it on their █████. Porpoise
meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that
a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
readily ███████████. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and
you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in █████████.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate. Very
savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger
than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. ███████ him,
and he will ██████ to a shark. I have ███████ for him many times, but
never yet saw him captured.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is
known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated,
is that of the ███████--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that
he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he ███████
in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less ██████ and jolly
girth; indeed, he is of quite a ████ and gentleman-like figure. He has
no ████ on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail,
and ███████████ Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth ██████
all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable,
yet a ████████ line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called
the "bright waist," that line ███████ him from ████ to stern, with two
separate ███████, black above and white below. The white █████████ part
of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he
had just escaped from a █████████ visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and
mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.


Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as
the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the
Leviathans of note. But there are a ██████ of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
reputation, but not personally. I shall █████████ them by their
fore-castle ████████████; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future █████████████, who may complete what I have here but █████. If
any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
he can readily be ████████████ into this System, according to his Folio,
Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The ██████-Nose Whale; the ████ Whale;
the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon
Whale; the ██████ Whale; the ████████ Whale; the Elephant Whale; the
Iceberg Whale; the ████ Whale; the Blue Whale; ███. From Icelandic,
Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be ██████ other █████ of
uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of ███████ names. But I ████
them as altogether ████████; and can hardly help ██████████ them for
mere sounds, full of ████████████, but ██████████ nothing.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
here, and at once, █████████. You cannot but plainly see that I have
kept my word. But I now leave my ███████████ System standing thus
██████████, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
█████ still standing upon the top of the ███████████ █████. For small
█████████ may be finished by their first ██████████; grand ones, true
ones, ever leave the copestone to █████████. God keep me from ever
██████████ anything. This whole book is but a draught--nay, but the
draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, ████, and ████████!



CHAPTER ██. The ███████████.


Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic ███████████ on ship-board, ███████
from the █████████ of the harpooneer █████ of officers, a class unknown
of course in any other ██████ than the whale-fleet.

The large importance ████████ to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly ██████ in
the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-██████;
usage, however, in time made it ██████████ to Chief Harpooneer. In
those days, the captain's authority was ██████████ to the ██████████
and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-███████
██████████ and all its ████████, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer
reigned supreme. In the ███████ Greenland Fishery, under the █████████
█████ of ████████████, this old Dutch ████████ is still retained, but
his former dignity is sadly ████████. At present he █████ simply
as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more
inferior ██████████. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,
but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the
command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand █████████
maxim of the sea ███████, that he should █████████ live apart from
the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior; though always, by them, ██████████ regarded as
their social equal.

Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
this--the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
███████████ alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the
captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly █████████████ with it.

Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
the █████████ of interest ██████████ among a company, all of whom, high
or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
common luck, together with their common █████████, ███████████, and
hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
████████ ██████████ than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
how much like an old ████████████ family these whalemen may, in some
primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom ██████████ ███████,
and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
which you will see the ███████ ████████ his quarter-deck with an ██████
████████ not █████████ in any military navy; nay, █████████ almost
as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
█████████ of pilot-cloth.

And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
given to that sort of ██████████ ██████████; and though the only homage
he ever ███████, was ████████, █████████████ █████████; though he
required no man to ██████ the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be ████████, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of █████████████ or IN
████████, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
███████████ of the █████████ forms and ██████ of the sea.

Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes ██████ himself; incidentally
making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
████████████ ████████ to ████████. That certain █████████ of his brain,
which had otherwise in a good degree remained ████████████; through
those forms that same sultanism became █████████ in an ████████████
████████████. For be a man's ████████████ ███████████ what it will,
it can never ██████ the practical, available █████████ over other men,
without the ███ of some sort of external arts and █████████████, always,
in themselves, more or less ██████ and base. This it is, that for ever
keeps God's true ███████ of the ██████ from the world's ████████; and
leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who
become famous more through their infinite ███████████ to the choice
hidden handful of the Divine █████, than through their █████████
superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks
in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,
that in some royal instances even to █████ ██████████ they have ████████
███████. But when, as in the case of ████████ the Czar, the ██████ crown
of ████████████ empire █████████ an imperial brain; then, the ████████
herds ██████ abased before the tremendous ██████████████. Nor, will the
tragic █████████ who would ██████ mortal ███████████████ in its fullest
sweep and direct █████, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in
his art, as the one now alluded to.

But Ahab, my Captain, still █████ before me in all his Nantucket
grimness and ██████████; and in this ███████ touching Emperors and
Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward ██████████ trappings
and ████████ are ██████ me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
must needs be ███████ at from the █████, and dived for in the deep, and
████████ in the ████████ air!



CHAPTER ██. The Cabin-Table.


It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale ████-of-bread
face from the cabin-scuttle, █████████ dinner to his lord and
master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an
███████████ of the sun; and is now ██████ █████████ the latitude on the
smooth, █████████-shaped tablet, ████████ for that █████ purpose on
the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete ███████████ to the
███████, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his ██████. But
presently, catching hold of the █████ shrouds, he ██████ himself to
the deck, and in an even, █████████████ voice, saying, "Dinner, Mr.
Starbuck," ██████████ into the cabin.

When the last ████ of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the
first ████, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck
██████ from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after
a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of ████████████,
"Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle. The second Emir ███████
about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to
see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise
takes up the old burden, and with a rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows
after his ████████████.

But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious █████████; for, ███████ all
sorts of knowing █████ in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he ███████ into a sharp but noiseless squall of a ████████ right
over the Grand ████'s head; and then, by a █████████ ███████, pitching
his cap up into the ████████ for a shelf, he goes down ██████████ so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck, █████████ all other
processions, by bringing up the rear with █████. But ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below, he ██████, ships a new face altogether, and,
then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab's presence,
in the character of ████████, or the Slave.

It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
██████████████ of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon ███████████, bear themselves boldly and
█████████ enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the next moment go down to their █████████ dinner in that
same commander's cabin, and straightway their ███████████, not to say
███████████ and ██████ air towards him, as he ████ at the head of
the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
difference? A ███████? Perhaps not. To have been ██████████, King of
███████; and to have been Belshazzar, not █████████ but ███████████,
therein certainly must have been some touch of ███████ grandeur. But he
who in the rightly regal and ███████████ spirit ████████ over his own
private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's ████████████ power
and ████████ of individual influence for the time; that man's royalty of
state ██████████ Belshazzar's, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who
has but once █████ his friends, has ██████ what it is to be ██████. It
is a ████████ of social ████████ which there is no ████████████. Now,
if to this consideration you ████████ the official supremacy of a
ship-master, then, by █████████, you will ██████ the cause of that
peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.

Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a ████, █████
sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his ███████ but still
███████████ ████. In his own proper turn, each officer ██████ to be
served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
there seemed not to ████ the smallest social █████████. With one mind,
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he carved
the chief ████ before him. I do not suppose that for the world they
would have ████████ that moment with the slightest observation, even
upon so ███████ a █████ as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
knife and ████, between which the █████ of beef was locked, Ahab thereby
motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as
though receiving ████; and cut it ████████; and a little started
if, perchance, the knife ██████ against the plate; and chewed it
███████████; and swallowed it, not without ██████████████. For, like
the Coronation banquet at █████████, where the ██████ Emperor ██████████
█████ with the seven Imperial ████████, so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab
███████ not ████████████; only he himself was ████. What a relief it was
to ███████ Stubb, when a rat made a sudden ██████ in the hold below. And
poor little Flask, he was the ████████ son, and little boy of this weary
family party. His were the █████████ of the ██████ beef; his would have
been the ██████████. For Flask to have ████████ to help himself, this
must have seemed to him ██████████ to ███████ in the first degree. Had
he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have
been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,
strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,
the ███████ were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did
Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him, on account of its ████████ his clear,
sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such
██████████ waters, butter was at a ███████, and therefore was not for
him, a █████████; however it was, Flask, alas! was a ██████████ man!

Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was badly
██████ in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
and yet they also have the privilege of ████████ in the rear. If Stubb
even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
████████, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask
must bestir himself, he will not get more than three █████████ that day;
for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.
Therefore it was that Flask once ████████ in private, that ever since he
had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never
known what it was to be otherwise than ██████, more or less. For what
he ███ did not so much ███████ his ██████, as keep it immortal in him.
Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from
my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the
mast. There's the ██████ of promotion now; there's the ██████ of glory:
there's the ████████ of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the Pequod had a ██████ against Flask in Flask's official
████████, all that sailor had to do, in order to ██████ █████ vengeance,
was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin
sky-light, sitting silly and ████████████ before awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in ████████
order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the ██████ steward. And then the three
harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its █████████ ████████.
They made a sort of temporary ████████' ████ of the high and mighty
cabin.

In strange contrast to the hardly █████████ ██████████ and nameless
invisible ████████████ of the captain's table, was the entire care-free
███████ and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
the harpooneers. While their ███████, the mates, seemed afraid of the
sound of the ██████ of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food
with such a ██████ that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;
they filled their ███████ like Indian ships all day loading with ██████.
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out
the █████████ made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was
fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly ████████ out of
the solid ██. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with
a ██████ ███-████-and-jump, then Tashtego had an █████████████ way of
████████████ him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once
Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, ████████ Dough-Boy's memory by
snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden ████████, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
circle ███████████ to ████████ him. He was naturally a very nervous,
shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the ███████
of a ████████ █████ and a hospital █████. And what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the ██████████ ██████████
███████████ of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one
continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished
with all things they demanded, he would escape from their ████████ into
his little pantry adjoining, and █████████ peep out at them through the
██████ of its door, till all was over.

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, ████████
his filed teeth to the Indian's: █████████ to them, Daggoo seated on the
floor, for a bench would have brought his ██████-██████ head to the low
████████; at every motion of his ████████ limbs, making the low cabin
█████████ to shake, as when an ███████ elephant goes passenger in a
ship. But for all this, the great negro was ███████████ ██████████,
not to say ██████. It seemed hardly possible that by such █████████████
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality ████████ through so broad,
████████, and ██████ a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed
strong and █████ deep of the abounding element of air; and through his
███████ nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by
beef or by bread, are ██████ made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a
mortal, barbaric █████ of the lip in eating--an ████ sound enough--so
much so, that the █████████ Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
Tashtego singing out for him to ███████ himself, that his bones might be
picked, the simple-██████ steward all but █████████ the crockery hanging
round him in the pantry, by his sudden ████ of the █████. Nor did the
█████████ which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
lances and other weapons; and with which ██████████, at dinner, they
would ██████████████ ███████ their knives; that grating sound did not at
all tend to ████████████ poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his
Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some
█████████, convivial █████████████. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard █████ the
white ██████ who █████ upon cannibals. Not a ██████ should he carry on
his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,
the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his █████████,
fable-█████████ ears, all their martial bones ████████ in them at every
step, like ███████ █████████ in █████████.

But, though these ██████████ dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but █████████ in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at █████████, and just before sleeping-time,
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.

In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by ██████
the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it
was something as a street-door enters a house; turning ███████ for
a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
████████ in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
was no companionship; ████████, Ahab was ████████████. Though nominally
included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
lived in the world, as the last of the ██████ Bears lived in settled
████████. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild █████ of
the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter
there, ███████ his own ████; so, in his █████████, howling old age,
Ahab's soul, shut up in the █████ trunk of his body, there fed upon the
sullen paws of its gloom!



CHAPTER ██. The Mast-Head.


It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due ████████ with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round.

In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
██████████████ with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty ████
even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
███████-█████ sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
██████████ the hope of █████████ one whale more.

Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure █████████ here.
I take it, that the earliest ████████ of mast-heads were the old
Egyptians; because, in all my ██████████, I find none █████ to them.
For though their ███████████, the ████████ of █████, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread
gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders
priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of
mast-head standers, is an █████████ based upon the general belief among
██████████████, that the first pyramids were founded for ████████████
████████: a theory singularly █████████ by the peculiar █████-like
█████████ of all four sides of those ████████; whereby, with prodigious
long ██████████ of their legs, those old ███████████ were ████ to █████
to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a
modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In
█████ ████████, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him
a lofty stone ██████ in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
his life on its ██████, hoisting his food from the ground with a
██████; in him we have a remarkable instance of a █████████
███████-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by ████
or ██████, ████, ████, or sleet; but █████████ ██████ everything out to
the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads
we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely
███████████ to the business of singing out upon ███████████ any strange
sight. There is ████████; who, upon the top of the ██████ of ███████,
stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;
careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis ████████, Louis
█████, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on
his towering main-mast in █████████, and like one of ████████' ███████,
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
will go. ███████ Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-█████, stands his
mast-head in █████████ Square; and ever when most ████████ by that
London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for
where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor
Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however
█████ invoked to ████████ by their ████████ the distracted decks
upon which they gaze; however it may be ████████, that their spirits
penetrate through the thick ████ of the future, and ██████ what shoals
and what rocks must be shunned.

It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
not so, is plainly evinced by an ████ for which Obed Macy, the sole
█████████ of Nantucket, stands ███████████. The worthy Obed tells us,
that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty
spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means
of nailed ██████, something as fowls go ████████ in a ███-house. A few
years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,
who, upon █████████ the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh
the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the
one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads
are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their
regular turns (as at the helm), and █████████ each other every two
hours. In the serene weather of the ███████ it is exceedingly pleasant
the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy ██████████ man it is delightful. There
you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the
deep, as if the masts were gigantic ██████, while beneath you and
between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even
as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous ████████ at old
██████. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with
nothing ███████ but the waves. The tranced ship ██████████ rolls; the
██████ █████ winds blow; everything resolves you into ███████. For the
most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime ██████████████ ███████
you; you hear no news; read no ████████; ██████ with startling accounts
of commonplaces never ██████ you into unnecessary ███████████; you hear
of no domestic ███████████; bankrupt ██████████; fall of stocks; are
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for
all your meals for three years and more are snugly ██████ in casks, and
your bill of fare is █████████.

In one of those southern █████████, on a long three or four years'
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
████████ that the place to which you ██████ so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly █████████
of anything approaching to a cosy ██████████████, or adapted to █████ a
comfortable █████████ of feeling, such as ████████ to a bed, a hammock,
a hearse, a ██████ box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
and snug ████████████ in which men temporarily ███████ themselves. Your
most usual point of █████ is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called
the t' gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the ████████
feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure,
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of
a watch-coat; but properly speaking the ████████ watch-coat is no more
of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is █████ inside of its
██████ ██████████, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out
of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim
crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of
a house as it is a mere ████████, or ██████████ skin ████████ you. You
cannot put a shelf or chest of ███████ in your body, and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.

Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern whale ship are ██████████ with those ████████ little █████
or pulpits, called CROW'S-█████, in which the look-outs of a Greenland
whaler are █████████ from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled "A Voyage among the
Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
██-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;" in
this █████████ volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with
a ██████████ ██████████████ account of the then recently ████████
CROW'S-████ of the ███████, which was the name of Captain Sleet's good
craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he
being the original ████████ and ████████, and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our
own names (we fathers being the original █████████ and █████████), so
likewise should we ██████████ after ourselves any other █████████ we
may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large
tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with
a movable side-██████ to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.
Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ██████ into it through a
little trap-█████ in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the
stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for
█████████, comforters, and coats. In front is a ███████ rack, in which
to keep your speaking ███████, pipe, █████████, and other ████████
████████████. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this
crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a █████ with him
(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for
the purpose of ███████ off the █████ █████████, or ███████ sea ████████
█████████ those waters; for you cannot ████████████ █████ at them from
the deck owing to the ██████████ of the water, but to shoot down upon
them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a █████ of love
for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed
conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so ████████ upon many
of these, and though he ██████ us to a very scientific account of his
███████████ in this crow's-nest, with a small ███████ he kept there for
the purpose of █████████████ the ██████ resulting from what is called
the "local ██████████" of all binnacle magnets; an █████ ██████████ to
the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the
Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down
blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very
████████ and scientific here, yet, for all his learned "binnacle
██████████," "███████ compass ████████████," and "███████████ errors,"
he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much ████████
in those profound magnetic ███████████, as to fail being attracted
████████████ towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely
tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.
Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the
honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he
should so utterly ██████ that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend
and █████████ it must have been, while with ████████ fingers and hooded
head he was studying the ███████████ aloft there in that bird's nest
within three or four ███████ of the ████.

But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly ██████ aloft as
Captain Sleet and his ████████████ were; yet that ████████████ is
greatly ███████-████████ by the ██████ contrasting serenity of those
█████████ seas in which we South fishers mostly █████. For one, I used
to ██████ up the rigging very █████████, resting in the top to have a
chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery ████████, and so at
last mount to my ultimate ███████████.

Let me make a clean breast of it here, and ███████ █████ that I kept but
sorry █████. With the problem of the universe █████████ in me, how
could I--being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
████████--how could I but ███████ hold my obligations to observe all
whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
every time."

And let me in this place ████████ ████████ you, ye ship-owners of
Nantucket! Beware of █████████ in your ████████ █████████ any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye; given to ████████████ ██████████████; and who
██████ to ship with the ███████ instead of ████████ in his head. Beware
of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be
killed; and this ██████-████ young █████████ will tow you ten █████
round the world, and never make you one ████ of sperm the ██████. Nor
are these █████████ at all ████████. For nowadays, the whale-fishery
█████████ an ██████ for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
young men, █████████ with the ███████ cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber. ██████ ██████ not ████████████ perches
himself upon the mast-head of some ████████ disappointed whale-ship, and
in moody phrase ██████████:--

"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."

Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task, ██████████ them with not feeling ██████████
"interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
██████████ have a notion that their ██████ is imperfect; they are
short-███████; what use, then, to strain the ██████ █████? They have
left their █████-glasses at home.

"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've been
cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
yet. Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here."
Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon; but ██████ into such an █████-like ████████████ of
██████, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the ████████
███████ of waves with thoughts, that at last he █████ his identity;
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
blue, bottomless soul, █████████ mankind and nature; and every
strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
█████-discovered, ████████ fin of some █████████████ form, seems to him
the embodiment of those ███████ thoughts that only people the soul by
continually ████████ through it. In this █████████ mood, thy spirit ████
away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like
███████'s █████████ ███████████ ashes, forming at last a part of every
shore the round globe over.

There is no life in thee, now, except that ███████ life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
the ███████████ █████ of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye,
move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity
comes back in horror. Over ██████████ ████████ you █████. And perhaps,
at mid-day, in the ███████ weather, with one half-█████████ ██████ you
drop through that ███████████ air into the summer sea, no more to rise
for ever. Heed it well, ye ██████████!



CHAPTER ██. The Quarter-Deck.


(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)


It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
hour, as country █████████, after the same meal, take a few turns in the
garden.

Soon his steady, ivory ██████ was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
dented, like ██████████ ██████, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
you ███████ gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
you would see still stranger foot-██████--the foot-prints of his one
██████████, ever-pacing thought.

But on the occasion in question, those █████ looked deeper, even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
thought was Ahab, that at every ███████ turn that he made, now at the
main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
outer movement.

"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the █████ that's in him █████
the █████. '█████ soon be out."

The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
deck, with the same intense ███████ of purpose in his aspect.

It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a ████ by the
bulwarks, and █████████ his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with
one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.

"Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

"Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab. "Mast-heads, there! come down!"

When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly ██████████████ faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
started from his ██████████; and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, █████████ of the wondering ██████████ among
the men; till Stubb ██████████ whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But
this did not last long. ██████████ pausing, he cried:--

"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"

"Sing out for him!" was the █████████ rejoinder from a score of ███████
voices.

"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild ████████ in his tones; observing the
hearty █████████ into which his ██████████ question had so ████████████
thrown them.

"And what do ye next, men?"

"Lower away, and after him!"

"And what ████ is it ye ████ to, men?"

"A dead whale or a stove boat!"

More and more strangely and ████████ glad and █████████, grew the
countenance of the old man at every █████; while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other, as if ██████████ how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly ███████████ questions.

But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost
convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--

"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale. Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen ██████ piece, men. D'ye
see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-████."

While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the ██████ of his jacket, as if
to ████████ its ██████, and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
████████████ that it seemed the ██████████ humming of the ██████ of his
vitality in him.

Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
other, and with a high raised voice ██████████: "█████████ of ye
██████ me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three █████
█████████ in his starboard █████--look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!"

"Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging ██████████ they
hailed the act of ███████ the gold to the mast.

"It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the ███████:
"a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water;
if ye see but a bubble, sing out."

All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
██████████ touched by some ████████ ████████████.

"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same that
some call Moby Dick."

"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab. "Do ye know the white whale then, ████?"

"Does he ███-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said the
Gay-Header deliberately.

"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very █████, even for a
parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"

"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
Captain," cried Queequeg ████████████, "all ██████-███ be-█████, like
him--him--" █████████ hard for a word, and ████████ his hand round and
round as though █████████ a bottle--"like him--him--"

"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
and ████████ in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of █████, and white as a pile of our Nantucket ████ after the
great ██████ sheep-████████; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
split ███ in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have
seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"

"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
been eyeing his superior with ██████████ surprise, but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. "Captain
Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick that took off
thy leg?"

"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
████████ all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye," he shouted with
a terrific, loud, animal ███, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that ██████ me; made a poor
███████ lubber of me for ever and a day!" Then tossing both arms, with
███████████ ████████████ he shouted out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him
round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the ██████ █████████, and
round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have
shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and
over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.
What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look
brave."

"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running ██████ to the
excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
Moby Dick!"

"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout. "God bless ye,
men. Steward! go draw the great measure of ████. But what's this long
face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
game for Moby Dick?"

"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many barrels
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it
will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market."

"Nantucket market! ████! But come closer, Starbuck; thou █████████
a little lower layer. If money's to be the ████████, man, and the
███████████ have ████████ their great counting-house the globe, by
████████ it with ███████, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let
me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!"

"He ██████ his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow."

"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply █████ thee
from ████████ instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,
Captain Ahab, seems ███████████."

"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer. All visible ███████, man,
are but as ██████████ █████. But in each █████--in the living act, the
undoubted ████--there, some unknown but still █████████ thing puts forth
the █████████ of its features from behind the ███████████ mask. If man
will strike, strike through the mask! How can the ████████ reach outside
except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that
wall, ██████ near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But
'tis enough. He █████ me; he █████ me; I see in him ██████████ strength,
with an inscrutable malice ████████ it. That inscrutable thing is
chiefly what I ████; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale
principal, I will █████ that hate upon him. Talk not to me of █████████,
man; I'd strike the sun if it ████████ me. For could the sun do that,
then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play
herein, ████████ █████████ over all █████████. But not my master, man,
is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no ████████. Take off
thine eye! more intolerable than ██████' ████████ is a ███████
stare! So, so; thou █████████ and ██████; my heat has melted thee to
█████-████. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing
██████ itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I
meant not to ███████ thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder ███████ cheeks of
███████ tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan
████████--the █████████ and █████████████ things, that live; and seek,
and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the
crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale?
See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder ███████! he ██████ to think of it.
Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one ████ sapling cannot,
Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a fin; no
wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt,
then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back,
when every ████████-hand has ████████ a whetstone? Ah! █████████████
█████ thee; I see! the billow █████ thee! Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye!
thy silence, then, THAT voices thee. (ASIDE) Something shot from my
dilated nostrils, he has ███████ it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine;
cannot ██████ me now, without █████████."

"God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit ████████████ of the mate, Ahab
did not hear his foreboding ██████████; nor yet the low laugh from the
hold; nor yet the █████████ ██████████ of the winds in the cordage;
nor yet the hollow ████ of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck's ████████ eyes lighted up with
the ████████████ of life; the ████████████ laugh died away; the winds
blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah,
ye ███████████ and ████████! why stay ye not when ye come? But
rather are ye ███████████ than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much
predictions from without, as █████████████ of the █████████ things
within. For with little external to █████████ us, the █████████
███████████ in our being, these still drive us on.

"The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.

Receiving the ████████ ██████, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near
the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates
stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company
formed a circle round the █████; he stood for an instant ███████████
eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the
█████████ eyes of the prairie ██████ meet the eye of their ██████, ere
he rushes on at their head in the trail of the █████; but, alas! only to
fall into the hidden █████ of the Indian.

"Drink and pass!" he cried, ███████ the heavy ███████ ██████ to the
nearest seaman. "The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
████████--long ████████, men; 'tis hot as █████'s ████. So, so; it
goes round ███████████. It ██████████ in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost ███████. That way it went, this
way it comes. Hand it me--here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
brimming life is ██████ and gone. Steward, ██████!

"Attend now, my ██████. I have ████████ ye all round this capstan; and
ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
with your █████; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
sort ██████ a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you
will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad ███████ come not sooner. Hand
it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, were't not thou St.
█████' ███--away, thou ████!

"Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let
me touch the axis." So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
nameless, interior ████████, he would fain have ███████ into them the
same fiery ███████ ███████████ within the ██████ jar of his own magnetic
life. The three mates ███████ before his strong, █████████, and mystic
aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of
Starbuck fell downright.

"In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well. For did ye three but
once take the full-forced shock, then mine own ████████ thing, THAT had
perhaps ███████ from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye
dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do
███████ ye three ██████████ to my three pagan ███████ there--yon three
most honourable gentlemen and ████████, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain
the task? What, when the great ████ ██████ the feet of ███████, using
his █████ for ████? Oh, my sweet █████████! your own condescension, THAT
shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your ████████
and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"

Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
up, before him.

"Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye
not the ██████ end? Turn up the ██████! So, so; now, ye ███-███████,
advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!" █████████,
slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
███████ with the fiery waters from the pewter.

"Now, three to three, ye stand. ███████ the murderous ████████! ██████
them, ye who are now made ███████ to this ████████████ ██████. Ha!
Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon █████████ sun now waits to sit upon
it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the ████████
█████████'s bow--Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt
Moby Dick to his death!" The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted;
and to cries and ████████████ against the white whale, the spirits were
simultaneously ███████ down with a ████. Starbuck █████, and turned, and
████████. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds
among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them, they all
dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.



CHAPTER ██. Sunset.


THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.


I leave a white and ██████ wake; pale waters, █████ cheeks, where'er I
sail. The ███████ billows ████████ swell to █████ my █████; let them;
but first I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's ███, the warm waves █████ like wine.
The gold brow ██████ the blue. The █████ sun--████ dived from noon--goes
down; my soul mounts up! she ███████ with her endless hill. Is, then,
the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of ████████. Yet is
it bright with many a ███; I the ██████, see not its far █████████; but
██████ feel that I wear that, that ██████████ █████████. 'Tis iron--that
I know--not gold. 'Tis split, too--that I feel; the ██████ edge █████
me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise █████ ███████
me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me;
all ██████████ is anguish to me, since I can ██'er enjoy. Gifted with
the high ██████████, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most ██████
and most ███████████! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night--good
night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW.)

'Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
but my one ██████ circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
███████. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
match itself must needs be wasting! What I've dared, I've ██████; and
what I've willed, I'll do! They think me mad--Starbuck does; but I'm
████████, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that's only calm
to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be ███████████;
and--Aye! I lost this leg. I now ████████ that I will █████████ my
███████████. Now, then, be the prophet and the █████████ one. That's
more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
███████-███████, ye █████████, ye ████ ██████ and ███████ █████████!
I will not say as ██████████ do to ███████--Take some one of your own
size; don't ██████ ME! No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but
YE have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your ██████ ████! I have
no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see
if ye can ██████ me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is
laid with iron █████, ███████ my soul is ███████ to run. Over █████████
██████, through the ██████ hearts of mountains, under ████████' beds,
██████████ I rush! Naught's an ████████, naught's an angle to the iron
way!



CHAPTER ██. ████.


BY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.


My soul is more than ███████; she's ██████████; and by a madman!
████████████ █████, that ██████ should ground arms on such a field! But
he ███████ deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see
his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, ████ I,
the ineffable thing has tied me to him; ████ me with a cable I have no
knife to cut. ████████ old man! Who's over him, he cries;--aye, he would
be a ████████ to all above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I
plainly see my miserable office,--to obey, █████████; and worse yet,
to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some █████ woe would
███████ me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide ████ wide.
The █████ whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small
gold-fish has its ██████ globe. His heaven-█████████ purpose, God may
█████ aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
clock's run down; my heart the all-███████████ weight, I have no key to
lift again.


[A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE.]


Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
███████ in them! ███████ somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale
is their ██████████. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward!
mark the ███████████ silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost
through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, █████████, █████████
bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his
█████████ cabin, ███████ over the dead water of the wake, and further
on, hunted by its wolfish █████████. The long ████ ███████ me through!
Peace! ye █████████, and set the watch! Oh, life! 'tis in an hour like
this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,--as wild, untutored
things are forced to ████--Oh, life! 'tis now that I do feel the latent
horror in thee! but 'tis not me! that horror's out of me! and with the
soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim,
phantom ███████! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!



CHAPTER ██. First Night Watch.

Fore-Top.

(STUBB █████, AND MENDING A BRACE.)


Ha! ha! ha! ha! ███! clear my throat!--I've been thinking over it
ever since, and that ha, ha's the final ███████████. Why so? Because a
laugh's the ██████, easiest answer to all that's queer; and come what
will, one comfort's always left--that █████████ comfort is, it's all
█████████████. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
the old █████ has fixed him, too. I ███████ it, knew it; had had the
gift, might readily have ██████████ it--for when I clapped my eye upon
his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, WISE Stubb--that's my title--well,
Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here's a ███████. I know not all that may be
coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
███████ as lurks in all your █████████! I feel funny. ██, la! █████,
██████! What's my juicy little pear at home doing now? ██████ its eyes
out?--Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
a ███████'s ███████, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh--

We'll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and ████████
As ███████ that swim, on the ██████'s brim, And break on the lips while
meeting.


A brave stave that--who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir--(ASIDE) he's
my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--Aye, aye, sir, just
through with this job--coming.



CHAPTER 40. Midnight, Forecastle.

HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.

(████████ RISES AND █████████ THE WATCH STANDING, LOUNGING, LEANING, AND
LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES, ALL SINGING IN CHORUS.)

     Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
     Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
     Our captain's commanded.--

1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the
█████████! Take a █████, follow me! (█████, AND ALL FOLLOW)

    Our captain stood upon the deck,
    A ███-glass in his hand,
    A ███████ of those gallant whales
    That blew at every ██████.
    Oh, your ████ in your boats, my boys,
    And by your ██████ stand,
    And we'll have one of those fine whales,
    Hand, boys, over hand!
    So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
    While the bold █████████ is striking the whale!

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight █████ there, forward!

███ NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d'ye hear,
bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou █████████! and let me
call the watch. I've the sort of mouth for that--the ████████ mouth.
So, so, (THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) ████-bo-█-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
Eight bells there below! Tumble up!

DUTCH SAILOR. Grand ████████ to-night, ████; fat night for that. I
mark this in our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as █████████ to some as
█████████ to others. We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like
ground-████ █████. At 'em again! There, take this ██████-████, and hail
'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their ██████. Tell 'em
it's the resurrection; they must ████ their last, and come to judgment.
That's the way--THAT'S it; thy throat ain't spoiled with eating
█████████ butter.

FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let's have a ███ or two before we ride to
anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand
by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP. (█████ AND SLEEPY) Don't know where it is.

FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and ███ thy ears. Jig it, men,
I say; merry's the word; hurrah! Damn me, won't you █████? Form, now,
Indian-████, and ██████ into the double-███████? Throw yourselves! Legs!
legs!

ICELAND SAILOR. I don't like your floor, maty; it's too ███████ to my
taste. I'm used to ice-██████. I'm sorry to throw cold water on the
subject; but ██████ me.

███████ SAILOR. Me too; where's your girls? Who but a fool would take
his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do? ████████! I
must have partners!

████████ SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!--then I'll hop with ye; yea,
turn grasshopper!

LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye ███████, there's plenty more of us.
███ corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here
comes the music; now for it!

█████ SAILOR. (ASCENDING, AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE.)
Here you are, Pip; and there's the windlass-█████; up you mount! Now,
boys! (THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE; SOME GO BELOW; SOME
SLEEP OR LIE AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING. █████ A-PLENTY.)

AZORE SAILOR. (DANCING) Go it, Pip! ████ it, bell-boy! Rig it, ███ it,
████ it, ████ it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the ████████!

PIP. Jinglers, you say?--there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.

CHINA SAILOR. ██████ thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a ██████ of
thyself.


FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy ████, Pip, till I jump through it!
Split ████! tear yourselves!

TASHTEGO. (QUIETLY SMOKING) That's a white man; he calls that fun:
█████! I save my █████.

OLD ████ SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
they are dancing over. I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's
the bitterest ██████ of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
corners. O ██████! to think of the green navies and the green-███████
crews! Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you ████████ have
it; and so 'tis right to make one ████████ of it. Dance on, lads, you're
young; I was once.

3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!--whew! this is worse than ███████ after
whales in a calm--give us a █████, Tash.

(THEY █████ DANCING, AND GATHER IN ████████. MEANTIME THE SKY
███████--THE WIND RISES.)

██████ SAILOR. By ██████! boys, it'll be █████ sail soon. The sky-born,
high-tide ██████ turned to wind! Thou ███████ thy black brow, █████!

MALTESE SAILOR. (█████████ AND SHAKING HIS CAP.) It's the waves--the
snow's caps turn to jig it now. They'll shake their ███████ soon. Now
would all the waves were women, then I'd go █████, and ███████ with them
████████! There's naught so sweet on earth--heaven may not match
it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
over-████████ arms hide such ████, bursting ██████.

SICILIAN SAILOR. (RECLINING.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad--fleet
████████████ of the limbs--lithe ████████--███████--███████████! lip!
heart! ███! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
else come ███████. Eh, Pagan? (███████.)

███████ SAILOR. (RECLINING ON A MAT.) Hail, holy █████████ of our
dancing girls!--the █████-Heeva! Ah! low ██████, high ██████ ██████! I
still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee █████
in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn
and ██████ quite. Ah me!--not thou nor I can bear the change! How
then, if so be ████████████ to yon sky? Hear I the roaring ███████ from
█████████'s ████ of spears, when they leap down the █████ and drown the
████████?--The blast! the blast! Up, █████, and meet it! (LEAPS TO HIS
FEET.)

██████████ SAILOR. How the sea rolls ████████ 'gainst the side! Stand
by for ███████, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, ████-████
they'll go ███████ presently.

DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou ████████, thou
███████! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He's no more
afraid than the isle ████ at ████████, put there to fight the ██████
with storm-lashed ████, on which the sea-salt █████!

███ NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old
Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
██████████ with a pistol--fire your ship right into it!

ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man's a grand old ████! We are the
lads to hunt him up his whale!

ALL. Aye! aye!

OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three █████ shake! Pines are the ███████ sort
of tree to live when ███████ to any other soil, and here there's none
but the crew's cursed ████. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort
of weather when brave hearts ████ ashore, and ██████ hulls split at sea.
Our captain has his █████████; look yonder, boys, there's another in the
sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

DAGGOO. What of that? Who's afraid of black's afraid of me! I'm quarried
out of it!

SPANISH SAILOR. (ASIDE.) He wants to █████, ah!--the old grudge makes
me ██████ (ADVANCING.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the ██████████ dark
side of mankind--devilish dark at that. No ███████.

DAGGOO (GRIMLY). None.

ST. ████'S SAILOR. That Spaniard's mad or █████. But that can't be, or
else in his one case our old Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in
working.

███ NANTUCKET SAILOR. What's that I saw--lightning? Yes.

SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.

DAGGOO (█████████). Swallow thine, ████████! White skin, white liver!

SPANISH SAILOR (MEETING HIM). Knife thee ████████! big frame, small
spirit!

ALL. A row! a row! a row!

TASHTEGO (WITH A WHIFF). A row a'low, and a row aloft--Gods and
men--both ████████! Humph!

███████ SAILOR. A row! █████ a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! ██████
in with ye!

ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard's knife! A ring, a ring!

OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
Cain struck ████. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad'st thou
the ring?

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in
top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef ████████!

ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my ███████! (THEY ███████.)


PIP (█████████ UNDER THE WINDLASS). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
█████, █████! there goes the jib-stay! █████-█████! God! ████ lower,
Pip, here comes the royal yard! It's worse than being in the ███████
woods, the last day of the year! Who'd go ████████ after chestnuts now?
But there they go, all ███████, and here I don't. Fine █████████ to 'em;
they're on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! ███████, what a squall!
But those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white ███████, they.
White squalls? white whale, █████! shirr! Here have I heard all their
chat just now, and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken of
once! and only this evening--it makes me ██████ all over like my
tambourine--that ████████ of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him! Oh,
thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on
this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no
bowels to feel fear!



CHAPTER ██. Moby Dick.


I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
my oath had been welded with theirs; and ████████ I shouted, and more
did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
wild, mystical, █████████████ feeling was in me; Ahab's ██████████ ████
seemed mine. With ██████ ears I learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of
████████ and ███████.

For some time past, though at intervals only, the █████████████,
secluded White Whale had ███████ those ███████████ seas mostly
frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his
existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him;
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-████████;
the ██████████ way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
circumference, many of them █████████████ pushing their quest along
solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a ███████, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort;
the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the ████████████ of the
times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct
and ████████, long ██████████ the spread through the whole world-wide
whaling-fleet of the special ███████████████ tidings concerning Moby
Dick. It was hardly to be ███████, that several vessels reported to have
encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a ████████,
a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and █████████, which whale, after
doing great ████████ to his ██████████, had completely escaped them; to
some █████ it was not an ██████ ███████████, I say, that the whale in
question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the
Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not ██████████
instances of great ferocity, ███████, and malice in the monster
attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
content to ascribe the peculiar ██████ he bred, more, as it were, to
the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual
cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.

And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
them, almost, as boldly and ██████████ lowered for him, as for any other
whale of that species. But at length, such ██████████ did █████ in these
assaults--not restricted to ████████ wrists and ██████, broken limbs, or
█████████ ███████████--but fatal to the last degree of ████████; those
repeated disastrous ████████, all ████████████ and ██████ their terrors
upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.

Nor did wild ██████ of all sorts fail to ██████████, and still the more
███████ the true █████████ of these deadly ██████████. For not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events,--as the ███████ tree gives birth to its █████; but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra █████, wild rumors ██████,
wherever there is any ████████ reality for them to █████ to. And as the
sea █████████ the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life, in the █████████████ and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes █████████ there. For not only are whalemen
as a body ████████ from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most
directly brought into ███████ with whatever is ███████████ ███████████
in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but,
hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that
though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you
would not come to any ████████ hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun; in such latitudes and ██████████, ████████ too
such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.

No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere ███████ over
the ██████ watery ██████, the ████████ rumors of the White Whale did
in the end ███████████ with themselves all manner of ██████ hints,
and half-formed ██████ ███████████ of supernatural agencies, which
eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors ██████████ from anything
that ███████ appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White
Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
jaw.

But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
Not even at the present day has the original ████████ of the Sperm
Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are
those this day among them, who, though intelligent and ██████████
enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
perhaps--either from professional ████████████, or ████████████, or
████████, ███████ a ███████ with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are
plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing
under the American flag, who have never █████████ encountered the Sperm
Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
the ███████ monster ███████████ pursued in the North; seated on their
hatches, these men will hearken with a ████████ fireside interest
and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the
pre-███████ ██████████████ of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more
█████████ comprehended, than on board of those █████ which stem him.

And as if the now ██████ reality of his might had in former
█████████ times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists--███████ and ████████--█████████ the Sperm Whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
██████████ █████████ as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or almost similar
impressions ███████. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself
███████ that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are
"struck with the most lively terrors," and "often in the ████████████ of
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
cause instantaneous death." And however the general experiences in the
fishery may █████ such ███████ as these; yet in their full ████████████,
even to the ████████████ item of Povelson, the █████████████ belief in
them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, ███████ in the minds of
the hunters.

So that ████████ by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
the fishermen ████████, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was ██████████ hard to induce long
█████████ Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
███████; such men ██████████ that ████████ other leviathans might be
█████████ pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would
be ██████████ to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
some remarkable █████████ that may be █████████.

Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him █████████ and vaguely, without the
specific ███████ of any certain ████████, and without superstitious
██████████████, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered.

One of the wild suggestions ████████ to, as at last coming to be linked
with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,
was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ██████████; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time.

Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
of the currents in the seas have never yet been ████████, even to
the most ███████ research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale
when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his
████████; and from time to time have ██████████ the most curious and
contradictory ████████████ regarding them, especially concerning the
mystic █████ whereby, after ████████ to a great █████, he ██████████
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
as well a thing placed upon █████████████ record years ago by Scoresby,
that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland
seas. Nor is it to be ████████, that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have ████████ very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem
to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real
living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of
the inland ███████ ████████ in ████████ (near whose top there was said
to be a ████ in which the ██████ of ships floated up to the surface);
and that still more wonderful story of the ████████ fountain near
████████ (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land
by an ███████████ passage); these fabulous ██████████ are almost fully
████████ by the █████████ of the whalemen.

Forced into ███████████, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped
alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only
ubiquitous, but immortal (for ███████████ is but ████████ in time); that
though ██████ of spears should be planted in his ██████, he would still
swim away ████████; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly █████████; for again in
█████████████ billows hundreds of leagues away, his █████████ jet would
once more be seen.

But even stripped of these supernatural ██████████, there was enough in
the earthly make and █████████████ character of the monster to strike
the ███████████ with ████████ power. For, it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead, and a high, ███████████ white hump. These were his █████████
features; the tokens whereby, even in the █████████, █████████ seas, he
revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and ███████ with
the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
his █████ aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a █████-way wake of ██████ foam, all ████████ with golden
█████████.

Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
as that ██████████, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
all, his treacherous retreats struck more of ██████ than perhaps aught
else. For, when swimming before his ████████ pursuers, with every
████████ ███████ of █████, he had several times been known to turn
round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to
splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.

Already several ██████████ had attended his chase. But though similar
█████████, however little ███████ ashore, were by no means unusual
in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's
infernal ████████████ of ferocity, that every ████████████ or death
that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been █████████ by an
█████████████ agent.

Judge, then, to what ███████ of ████████, distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were ████████, when amid the chips of chewed
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white █████ of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
sunlight, that ██████ on, as if at a birth or a ██████.

His three boats stove around him, and ████ and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, ███████ the line-knife from his broken prow, had
dashed at the whale, as an ████████ ████████ at his foe, blindly seeking
with a six inch blade to reach the ██████-deep life of the whale.
That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's
leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No ████████ Turk, no
█████ ████████ or █████, could have smote him with more seeming malice.
Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild ██████████████ against the whale,
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
to ████████ with him, not only all his bodily ████, but all his
intellectual and spiritual █████████████. The White Whale swam before
him as the ██████████ ███████████ of all those malicious agencies which
some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with
half a heart and half a ████. That ██████████ malignity which has been
from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds; which the ancient ███████ of the east ██████████
in their ██████ devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;
but ███████████ ████████████ its idea to the ████████ white whale, he
██████ himself, all █████████, against it. All that most ███████ and
████████; all that █████ up the lees of things; all truth with malice
in it; all that cracks the ██████ and cakes the brain; all the subtle
█████████ of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly
███████████, and made ███████████ ██████████ in Moby Dick. He piled upon
the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a
██████, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.

It is not ████████ that this █████████ in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily █████████████. Then, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
████████ █████████; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
probably but felt the █████████ bodily ██████████, but nothing more.
Yet, when by this █████████ forced to turn towards home, and for long
months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one
hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;
then it was, that his torn body and ██████ soul bled into one another;
and so ███████████, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward
voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems
all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,
he was a ██████ ███████; and, though ████████ of a leg, yet such vital
strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover ███████████
by his ████████, that his mates were forced to ████ him fast, even
there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung
to the mad ████████ of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable
latitudes, the ship, with mild ████'sails spread, floated across the
████████ tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed
left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his
dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that
firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once
again; and his mates ███████ God the direful madness was now gone; even
then, Ahab, in his hidden self, █████ on. Human madness is oftentimes a
cunning and most ██████ thing. When you think it fled, it may have but
become ████████████ into some still ███████ form. Ahab's full ██████
████████ not, but ███████████ contracted; like the ████████ ██████,
when that noble ████████ █████ narrowly, but ████████████ through the
████████ █████. But, as in his narrow-███████ monomania, not one jot of
Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not
one jot of his great natural █████████ had perished. That before living
agent, now became the living ██████████. If such a furious █████ may
stand, his special lunacy ███████ his general sanity, and carried it,
and turned all its ██████████ cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far
from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had ██████ brought to bear upon
any one reasonable object.

This is much; yet Ahab's larger, ██████, deeper part remains ████████.
But vain to ██████████ ████████████, and all truth is profound. Winding
far down from within the very heart of this ██████ █████ de █████ where
we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your
way, ye ██████, ██████ souls, to those vast Roman █████ of ███████;
where far beneath the █████████ ██████ of man's upper earth, his root
of grandeur, his whole awful ███████ sits in bearded state; an antique
buried beneath antiquities, and ███████ on ███████! So with a broken
throne, the great gods ████ that ███████ king; so like a ████████, he
patient sits, █████████ on his frozen brow the piled ████████████ of
ages. Wind ye down there, ye ███████, sadder souls! question that proud,
███ king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young ██████
█████████; and from your grim ████ only will the old State-secret come.

Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, ██████: all my means
are ████, my ██████ and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
change, or ████ the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
█████████; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his ███████████
was only subject to his ██████████████, not to his will determinate.
Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally ███████, and that to the quick, with the
terrible ████████ which had █████████ him.

The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added █████████ which
always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
present voyage, sat ████████ on his brow. Nor is it so very ████████,
that far from ███████████ his ███████ for another whaling voyage, on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he
was all the better █████████ and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
of rage and ████████ as the bloody hunt of whales. ██████ within and
scorched without, with the ███████, ███████████ fangs of some █████████
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most █████████ of all ██████.
Or, if for any reason thought to be ███████████ █████████████ for that,
yet such an one would seem █████████████ competent to cheer and howl on
his ██████████ to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and █████ in
him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
and all-██████████ object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
then, how soon would their aghast and █████████ souls have wrenched the
ship from such a ████████ man! They were bent on ██████████ cruises, the
profit to be ███████ down in dollars from the ████. He was intent on an
audacious, ███████████, and supernatural revenge.

Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, ███████ with ██████ a
Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of ███████ renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--███████ █████████
also, by the ████████████ of mere ███████ virtue or right-██████████ in
Starbuck, the ███████████ ███████ of indifference and ████████████ in
Stubb, and the pervading ██████████ in Flask. Such a crew, so █████████,
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so ███████████ █████████
to the old man's ███--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much
their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the White
Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious ██████████████, also, in
some dim, ███████████ way, he might have seemed the gliding great █████
of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
Ishmael can go. The subterranean █████ that works in us all, how can one
tell ███████ leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What █████ in tow
of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the
███████████ of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to
encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the █████████
ill.



CHAPTER ██. The █████████ of The Whale.


What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains ██████.

Aside from those more obvious ██████████████ touching Moby Dick, which
could not but occasionally ██████ in any man's soul some alarm, there
was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which at times by its intensity completely ███████████ all the rest; and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of
putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale
that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself
here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all
these chapters might be naught.

Though in many natural objects, whiteness ██████████ enhances ██████, as
if █████████ some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, █████████,
and ██████; and though various nations have in some way recognised a
certain royal ███████████ in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old
kings of ████ placing the title "Lord of the White █████████" above all
their other ████████████ ███████████ of dominion; and the modern kings
of ████ █████████ the same snow-white █████████ in the royal ████████;
and the ██████████ flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white ███████;
and the great ████████ Empire, █████████, ████ to ███████████ Rome,
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this
pre-████████ in it ███████ to the human race itself, giving the white
man ideal ██████████ over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all
this, whiteness has been even made significant of ████████, for among
the ██████ a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal
██████████ and ████████████, this same hue is made the ██████ of many
touching, noble things--the innocence of ██████, the █████████ of age;
though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt
of ██████ was the deepest ██████ of honour; though in many climes,
whiteness ████████ the majesty of ███████ in the ██████ of the Judge,
and ███████████ to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white ██████; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the ██████ of the divine ████████████
and power; by the Persian fire ███████████, the white ██████ flame being
held the ███████ on the altar; and in the Greek ███████████, Great Jove
himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the
noble ████████, the █████████ █████████ of the sacred White Dog was
by far the holiest ████████ of their theology, that ████████, faithful
creature being held the ██████ █████ they could send to the Great Spirit
with the annual tidings of their own ████████; and though directly from
the Latin word for white, all Christian ███████ derive the name of
one part of their sacred vesture, the ███ or █████, worn beneath the
███████; and though among the holy █████ of the ██████ faith, white is
specially employed in the ███████████ of the Passion of our Lord; though
in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and
the four-and-twenty ██████ stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne, and the Holy One that ███████ there white like wool; yet for all
these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable,
and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that ███████
which █████████ in blood.

This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
████████ from more ██████ associations, and coupled with any object
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the ████████ ██████.
███████ the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;
what but their smooth, █████ whiteness makes them the ████████████
horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which ███████ such an
█████████ ████████, even more █████████ than terrific, to the dumb
████████ of their aspect. So that not the fierce-██████ tiger in his
████████ coat can so ███████ courage as the white-shrouded bear or
shark.*


*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be █████ by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not
the whiteness, separately regarded, which █████████ the intolerable
███████████ of that brute; for, ████████, that heightened hideousness,
it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
█████████████ █████████████ of the creature stands invested in the
██████ of █████████ innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrast. But even ████████ all this to be true;
yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
terror.

As for the white shark, the white gliding ███████████ of repose in that
creature, when ██████ in his ordinary moods, strangely ███████ with the
same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most ███████
hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
mass for the dead begins with "███████ ███████" (eternal rest), whence
REQUIEM ████████████ the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now,
in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and
the mild ██████████ of his habits, the French call him ██████.


Bethink thee of the █████████, whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
████████████? Not █████████ first threw that spell; but God's great,
████████████ ████████, Nature.*


*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
below, I ascended to the ███████████ deck; and there, dashed upon the
main hatches, I saw a regal, ████████ thing of █████████ whiteness, and
with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth
its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
flutterings and ██████████ shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
█████████████, strange eyes, █████████ I peeped to secrets which took
hold of God. As ███████ before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
waters, I had lost the miserable ███████ memories of traditions and of
towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of ███████. I cannot tell, can only
hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A █████, he replied. Goney!
never had heard that name before; is it ███████████ that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by no
possibility could Coleridge's wild █████ have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our
deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be
an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly ███████ a little
brighter the noble █████ of the ████ and the poet.

I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,
that by a ████████ of terms there are birds called grey ███████████;
and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I
beheld the Antarctic fowl.

But how had the mystic thing been caught? ███████ it not, and I will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
At last the Captain made a ███████ of it; █████ a ████████, ████████
█████ round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and then letting
it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the ████-folding,
the ████████, and ███████ ████████!


Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-███████, and with the dignity of a
thousand ████████ in his lofty, ████████████ carriage. He was the
███████ ██████ of vast herds of wild ██████, whose pastures in those
days were only ██████ by the Rocky Mountains and the ███████████. At
their ███████ head he westward ███████ it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the █████ of light. The ████████ ███████ of his
████, the curving █████ of his tail, invested him with housings more
███████████ than gold and silver-███████ could have furnished him. A
most imperial and █████████████ apparition of that ████████, western
world, which to the eyes of the old ████████ and hunters revived the
███████ of those ████████ times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
bluff-██████ and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
his █████ and ████████ in the van of █████████ ███████ that █████████
████████ it over the ██████, like an ████; or whether with his
█████████████ subjects ████████ all around at the horizon, the White
Steed ███████████ ████████ them with warm nostrils █████████ through his
cool █████████; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the
bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor
can it be ██████████ from what stands on legendary record of this noble
horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him
with ██████████; and that this divineness had that in it which, though
commanding worship, at the same time ████████ a certain nameless terror.

But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
█████████ and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
Albatross.

What is it that in the ██████ man so ██████████ ██████ and often ██████
the eye, as that sometimes he is ███████ by his own kith and kin! It
is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name
he bears. The Albino is as well made as other men--has no ███████████
█████████--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ███████ ████████. Why should this be so?

Nor, in quite other ███████, does Nature in her least ████████ but
not the less malicious agencies, fail to ██████ among her forces
this ████████ █████████ of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
██████████ ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
Squall. Nor, in some ████████ instances, has the art of human malice
███████ so ██████ an █████████. How wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in █████████, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
███████, the desperate White █████ of █████ murder their ███████ in the
market-place!

Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the ███████████████ of this hue. It
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the █████, is the marble ██████ lingering
there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal ███████████ here. And
from that pallor of the dead, we ██████ the ██████████ hue of the shroud
in which we ████ them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ██████ rising in a
milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even
the king of terrors, when personified by the ██████████, █████ on his
pallid horse.

Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
█████████ significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.

But though without ███████ this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
account for it? To ███████ it, would seem impossible. Can we, then,
by the ████████ of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to ██████ to it aught fearful,
but nevertheless, is found to █████ over us the same ███████, however
modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some chance ████ to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek?

Let us try. But in a matter like this, ████████ ███████ to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
though, doubtless, some at least of the ███████████ impressions about
to be presented may have been ██████ by most men, yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to
recall them now.

Why to the man of untutored ████████, who happens to be but ███████
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the ████ mention
of ███████████ marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless
processions of slow-pacing ████████, down-cast and hooded with
new-fallen snow? Or, to the ██████, ███████████████ ██████████ of the
Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White █████ or
a White ███, █████ such an ███████ statue in the soul?

Or what is there apart from the traditions of █████████ warriors and
kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White
Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an ███████████ American, than those other storied ██████████, its
neighbors--the ██████ Tower, or even the Bloody? And those ████████
towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is full of a soft,
████, distant ██████████? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a ████████████
over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea █████ us with mortal
thoughts of long █████████ mild ██████████ on the waves, followed by
the ████████ and yet █████████ of ███████? Or, to choose a wholly
█████████████ instance, ██████ addressed to the fancy, why, in reading
the old █████ tales of Central Europe, does "the tall pale man" of the
█████ forests, whose ██████████ pallor ████████████ glides through the
green of the groves--why is this phantom more terrible than all the
████████ ████ of the ██████████?

Nor is it, altogether, the ███████████ of her cathedral-████████
███████████; nor the ██████████ of her frantic seas; nor the
████████████ of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires, wrenched ████-stones, and ███████ all ██████
(like ██████ yards of anchored fleets); and her ████████ avenues of
house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of █████;--it
is not these things alone which make ████████ ████, the strangest,
███████ city thou can'st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as ███████,
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; ██████ not the cheerful
greenness of complete █████; ███████ over her broken ████████ the █████
pallor of an apoplexy that █████ its own ███████████.

I know that, to the common apprehension, this ██████████ of whiteness
is not █████████ to be the prime agent in ████████████ the terror of
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the █████████████ mind is there aught
of terror in those appearances whose █████████ to another mind almost
solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when █████████ under
any form at all approaching to ████████ or ████████████. What I mean
by these two statements may perhaps be ████████████ ██████████ by the
following ████████.

First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by
night he hear the ████ of breakers, ██████ to vigilance, and feels just
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his █████████; but under precisely
similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his
ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness--as if from
██████████ █████████ shoals of ██████ white bears were swimming round
him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom
of the ████████ waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the
lead ███████ him he is still off █████████; heart and helm they both go
down; he never █████ till blue water is under him again. Yet where is
the mariner who will tell thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of
striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stirred me?"

Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
████████████ Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
mere ████████ of the eternal frosted ████████████ ████████ at such vast
█████████, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
to lose ███████ in such ███████ █████████. Much the same is it with the
████████████ of the West, who with ███████████ indifference █████ an
█████████ prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the
███████ of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal █████
of ███████████ in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
███████████, instead of rainbows speaking hope and ██████ to his misery,
views what seems a boundless ██████████ grinning upon him with its lean
ice █████████ and splintered crosses.

But thou ██████, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but
a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou ████████████ to a ████,
Ishmael.

Tell me, why this strong young colt, ██████ in some peaceful valley of
███████, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon the
████████ day, if you but shake a fresh ███████ ████ behind him, so that
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal █████████--why
will he start, █████, and with bursting eyes ███ the ground in █████████
of ████████? There is no remembrance in him of any ███████ of wild
creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he
smells cannot recall to him anything ██████████ with the experience of
former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black
██████ of distant ██████?

No; but here thou █████████ even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the ████████ in the world. Though thousands of miles from
Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the ███████, ██████ bison
herds are as present as to the deserted wild ████ of the prairies, which
this instant they may be trampling into dust.

Thus, then, the muffled ████████ of a milky sea; the bleak █████████
of the █████████ frosts of mountains; the ████████ █████████ of the
█████████ █████ of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!

Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
those things must █████. Though in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love, the invisible ███████ were formed in fright.

But not yet have we ██████ the ███████████ of this whiteness, and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the
most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the ████████████ agent in
things the most appalling to mankind.

Is it that by its ██████████████ it shadows forth the █████████ voids
and immensities of the universe, and thus █████ us from behind with the
thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the ████████ of all
colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb █████████,
full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a colourless, all-colour
of ███████ from which we ██████? And when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues--every stately
or lovely ███████████--the sweet ██████ of sunset skies and woods; yea,
and the ██████ velvets of ███████████, and the butterfly cheeks of
young girls; all these are but ███████ deceits, not actually ████████
in ██████████, but only laid on from without; so that all ███████ Nature
██████████ ██████ like the ██████, whose ███████████ cover nothing but
the ███████-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
the mystical ████████ which ████████ every one of her hues, the great
principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and
if █████████ without ██████ upon matter, would touch all objects, even
██████ and roses, with its own █████ █████--█████████ all this, the
palsied universe lies before us a █████; and like wilful ██████████ in
███████, who refuse to wear coloured and █████████ glasses upon their
eyes, so the wretched infidel █████ himself █████ at the ██████████
white shroud that █████ all the prospect around him. And of all these
things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery
hunt?



CHAPTER ██. Hark!


"HIST! Did you hear that noise, ██████?"

It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
██████, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the ███████
to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the ████████
█████████ of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or ██████
their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
only broken by the ██████████ flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
███████████ advancing keel.

It was in the midst of this repose, that █████, one of the cordon, whose
post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his ████████, a █████, the
words above.

"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"

"Take the ██████, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"

"There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a █████--it
sounded like a cough."

"Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket."

"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three ████████ turning
over, now!"

"███████! have done, shipmate, will ye? It's the three ██████ ████████
ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else. Look to the
bucket!"

"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."

"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old
Quakeress's ████████-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you're
the chap."

"Grin away; we'll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind."

"████! the bucket!"



CHAPTER ██. The Chart.


Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
took place on the night ██████████ that wild ████████████ of his purpose
with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom,
and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of █████████ sea ██████, spread
them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before
it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and
████████ which there met his eye; and with slow but steady ██████ trace
additional ███████ over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he
would █████ to █████ of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down
the seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various
ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.

While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses
on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also ███████ lines and
courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.

But it was not this night in particular that, in the ████████ of his
cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
others were ███████████. For with the charts of all four oceans before
him, Ahab was threading a ████ of currents and eddies, with a view to
the more certain ██████████████ of that monomaniac thought of his soul.

Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
it might seem an ████████ hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the ████████ oceans of this planet. But not so did it
seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
calculating the █████████ of the sperm whale's food; and, also, calling
to mind the regular, ███████████ seasons for hunting him in particular
latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
███████████, concerning the █████████ day to be upon this or that ground
in search of his prey.

So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the ██████████████ of the
sperm whale's █████████ to given waters, that many hunters believe that,
could he be closely observed and ███████ throughout the world; were the
████ for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully ████████,
then the ██████████ of the sperm whale would be found to ██████████ in
█████████████ to those of the herring-shoals or the ███████ of swallows.
On this hint, attempts have been made to █████████ █████████ █████████
charts of the sperm whale.*

     *Since the above was written, the █████████ is happily borne
     out by an official ████████, issued by ██████████ █████, of
     the National ███████████, Washington, April ████, ████. By
     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of ██████████; and portions of it are presented in
     the circular. "This chart ███████ the ocean into █████████
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of █████████;
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     ███████ for the twelve months; and ████████████ through each
     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each █████ in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen."

Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
sperm whales, ██████ by some infallible instinct--say, rather, secret
intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are called;
continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such ███████████
██████████, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with
one █████ of such marvellous █████████. Though, in these cases, the
direction taken by any one whale be straight as a ████████'s parallel,
and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
███████████, straight wake, yet the █████████ ████ in which at these
times he is said to swim, generally ████████ some few miles in █████
(more or less, as the vein is presumed to ██████ or contract); but
never ███████ the visual sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads,
when █████████████ gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
particular seasons within that ███████ and along that path, █████████
whales may with great confidence be looked for.

And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
the widest ████████ of water between those grounds he could, by his
art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meeting.

There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to ████████ his
█████████ but still ██████████ ██████. But not so in the reality,
perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
say, will turn out to be ███████████ the same with those that were found
there the █████████ ██████; though there are peculiar and ██████████████
instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the
same ██████, only within a less wide limit, applies to the ██████████
and hermits among the ███████, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby
Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the
█████████ ground in the Indian ocean, or ███████ Bay on the Japanese
Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of
those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly
encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where
he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his ██████
stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged
abode. And where Ahab's chances of █████████████ his object have
hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever
way-side, ██████████, █████ prospects were his, ere a particular
set time or place were attained, when all █████████████ would become
█████████████, and, as Ahab ██████ thought, every possibility the next
thing to a █████████. That particular set time and place were █████████
in the one █████████ phrase--the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then,
for several ███████████ years, Moby Dick had been ████████████ descried,
lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round,
███████ for a █████████ interval in any one sign of the ██████. There
it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had
taken place; there the waves were storied with his █████; there also was
that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive
to his vengeance. But in the ████████ █████████████████ and ███████████
vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his █████ upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned, however ██████████ it might be to those
hopes; nor in the █████████████ of his vow could he so tranquillize his
███████ heart as to ████████ all ███████████ quest.

Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
to make the great passage ██████████, double Cape Horn, and then running
down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the ██████████ Pacific in time
to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ███████ season.
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been
correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of
things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days
and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of ███████████
████████ ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance
the White Whale, spending his ████████ in seas far remote from his
periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the
Persian Gulf, or in the ██████ Bay, or China Seas, or in any other
waters haunted by his race. So that ████████, ██████, Nor'-███████,
██████████, ██████; any wind but the ████████ and ██████, might
blow Moby Dick into the ███████ ███-███ world-circle of the Pequod's
████████████████ wake.

But granting all this; yet, regarded ██████████ and coolly, seems it not
but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
███████████ from his hunter, even as a white-bearded █████ in the
████████ thoroughfares of ██████████████? Yes. For the peculiar
snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but
be ████████████. And have I not ███████ the whale, Ahab would mutter
to himself, as after ██████ over his charts till long after midnight he
would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?
His broad fins are bored, and █████████ out like a lost sheep's ear! And
here, his mad mind would run on in a ██████████ race; till a █████████
and █████████ of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the
deck he would seek to ███████ his strength. Ah, God! what ███████
of torments does that man endure who is ████████ with one ██████████
██████████ desire. He sleeps with ████████ hands; and wakes with his own
bloody nails in his palms.

Often, when forced from his hammock by ██████████ and ███████████ vivid
dreams of the night, which, ████████ his own intense thoughts through
the day, carried them on amid a ████████ of phrensies, and whirled them
round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very █████████
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes
the case, these spiritual ██████ in him heaved his being up from its
base, and a █████ seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and
██████████ shot up, and accursed fiends ████████ him to leap down among
them; when this hell in himself ██████ beneath him, a wild cry would be
heard through the ship; and with ███████ eyes Ahab would burst from his
state room, as though ████████ from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,
perhaps, instead of being the ██████████████ symptoms of some latent
████████, or fright at his own ███████, were but the ████████ tokens
of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the ████████,
████████████ steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had
gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from
it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or
soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time ███████████ from the
██████████████ mind, which at other times employed it for its outer
███████ or agent, it █████████████ sought escape from the scorching
██████████ of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no
longer an ████████. But as the mind does not exist unless ███████ with
the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, ████████ up
all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,
by its own █████ ██████████ of will, forced itself against gods and
devils into a kind of self-███████, independent being of its own. Nay,
could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was
conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and ██████████ birth.
Therefore, the tormented spirit that ██████ out of bodily eyes, when
what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a ███████
thing, a ████████ ██████████████ being, a ray of living light, to be
sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness in
itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature
in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a ██████████; a
███████ feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature
he ███████.



CHAPTER ██. The █████████.


So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars
in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier
part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the
leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly
enlarged upon, in order to be ██████████ understood, and moreover to
take away any ███████████ which a profound ignorance of the entire
subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural ██████ of the main
points of this affair.

I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall
be content to produce the desired impression by separate █████████ of
items, practically or ████████ known to me as a whaleman; and from these
citations, I take it--the conclusion █████ at will naturally follow of
itself.

First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
receiving a harpoon, has ████████ a complete escape; and, after an
interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by
the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
private ██████, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
three years ██████████ between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I
think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
them happening, in the interval, to go in a ███████ ship on a voyage to
Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and ██████████ far
into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
often ██████████ by ████████, savages, ██████, █████████ ███████,
with all the other common perils ████████ to wandering in the heart of
unknown ███████. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have
been on its ███████; no doubt it had thrice ███████████████ the globe,
████████ with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
This man and this whale again came together, and the one ██████████ the
other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that
is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,
saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards
taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out
that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time
distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's
eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,
but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,
then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many
other instances from persons whose ████████ in the matter there is no
good ground to ███████.

████████: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
██████████ instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly ██████████. Why such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by ███████ him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of ████████████ about
such a whale as there did about ███████ █████████, insomuch that
most fishermen were content to █████████ him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
without seeking to █████████ a more intimate ████████████. Like some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an █████████ great man, they
make distant ███████████ ███████████ to him in the street, lest if they
pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a ███████ thump for
their presumption.

But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
█████████--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide ██████; not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted into all the rights, ██████████, and distinctions of
a name; had as much a name indeed as ████████ or Caesar. Was it not so,
O █████ Tom! thou █████ leviathan, ███████ like an iceberg, who so long
did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft
seen from the █████ beach of █████? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack!
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of
the ██████ Land? Was it not so, O ███████! King of Japan, whose lofty
jet they say at times assumed the █████████ of a snow-white cross
against the sky? Was it not so, O Don ██████! thou Chilian whale, marked
like an old ████████ with mystic █████████████ upon the back! In plain
█████, here are four whales as well known to the ████████ of ████████
History as ██████ or █████ to the ███████ ███████.

But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
times ████████ great █████ among the boats of different vessels, were
finally gone in quest of, ██████████████ hunted out, chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their ███████ with
that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
████████████ Woods, Captain ██████ of old had it in his mind to capture
that █████████ murderous savage ███████, the ████████ warrior of the
Indian King ██████.

I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
███████ form ████████████ in all respects the ██████████████ of the
whole story of the White Whale, more especially the ███████████. For
this is one of those █████████████ instances where truth requires full
as much ██████████ as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without
some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
fishery, they might █████ at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable ████████.

First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
██████████ of those perils, and the █████████ with which they █████.
One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
██████ by ██████████ in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
however █████████ and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
whale-line off the coast of New ██████, is being carried down to the
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan--do you suppose that that
poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper ████████ you will read
to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the █████ are very irregular
between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a
death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each
lost a boat's crew. For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and
candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was
spilled for it.

Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold ████████████,
they have █████████████ complimented me upon my █████████████; when, I
declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being █████████ than Moses,
when he wrote the history of the ███████ of Egypt.

But ███████████ the special point I here seek can be established upon
█████████ entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it.

First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain ███████, of Nantucket,
was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of
the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
ship. ███████ his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in
less than "ten minutes" she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving
plank of her has been seen since. After the ████████ ████████, part of
the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,
Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another
ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and
breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith
███████████ the sea, he has never ███████ it since. At this day Captain
Pollard is a ████████ of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was
chief mate of the Essex at the time of the ███████; I have read his
plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all
this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*


*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact seemed
to ███████ me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
████████ his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
direction, were calculated to do us the most ██████, by being made
ahead, and thereby █████████ the speed of the two objects for the shock;
to effect which, the exact ██████████ which he made were necessary. His
aspect was most horrible, and such as █████████ ██████████ and fury. He
came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in
which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge
for their ██████████." Again: "At all events, the whole circumstances
taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the
time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the
part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall),
induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion."

Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during
a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore. "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the
dismal looking █████, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
wholly █████████ my reflections, until day again made its appearance."

In another place--█. 45,--he ██████ of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK
OF THE ANIMAL."


Secondly: The ship █████, also of Nantucket, was in the year ████
totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions
to it.

███████: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then
commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
██████ with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in
the harbor of ████, ████████ Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
the Commodore was pleased to be █████████ touching the ███████ strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He ████████████
denied for example, that any whale could so █████ his stout sloop-of-war
as to cause her to leak so much as a ██████████. Very good; but there
is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this
impregnable craft for ██████████. But he was stopped on the way by a
portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business
with him. That business █████████ in fetching the Commodore's craft such
a ██████, that with all his █████ going he made straight for the nearest
port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider
the Commodore's █████████ with that whale as ████████████. Was not ████
of ██████ converted from ████████ by a similar fright? I tell you, the
sperm whale will stand no nonsense.

I will now refer you to ██████████'s Voyages for a little circumstance
in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer ██████. Langsdorff, you
must know by the way, was attached to the ███████ Admiral Krusenstern's
famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his ███████████ chapter:

"By the ██████████ of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
we were out in the open sea, on our way to ███████. The weather was very
clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
our ███ clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not
till the ██████████ that a brisk gale from the █████████ sprang up. An
uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,
lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any
one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,
was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking
against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this
gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at
least out of the water. The masts ██████, and the sails fell altogether,
while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding
that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster
sailing off with the utmost ███████ and solemnity. Captain D'████
applied immediately to the pumps to ███████ whether or not the vessel
had received any ██████ from the shock, but we found that very happily
it had escaped entirely █████████."

Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
question, is a New █████████, who, after a long life of unusual
adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
██████████ near ██████. I have the honour of being a ██████ of his. I
have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.
He █████████████ every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large
one: a Russian craft built on the ████████ coast, and █████████ by my
uncle after █████████ away the vessel in which he sailed from home.

In that up and down █████ book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
of honest wonders--the voyage of ██████ █████, one of ancient ███████'s
old █████--I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted
from Langsdorff, that I cannot ███████ inserting it here for a
█████████████ example, if such be needed.

Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John ██████████," as he calls
the modern ████ █████████. "In our way thither," he says, "about four
o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues
from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our
men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were
or what to think; but every one began to ███████ for death. And, indeed,
the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for ███████ the
ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little
over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The
██████████ of the shock made the guns leap in their █████████, and
several of the men were ██████ out of their ████████. Captain █████, who
lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!" Lionel then
goes on to ██████ the shock to an ██████████, and seems to ████████████
the ██████████ by ███████ that a great earthquake, somewhere about
that time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But
I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the
morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically
███████ the hull from beneath.

I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the █████████
boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
withstand all the lances ██████ at him from its decks. The English ship
█████ Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength,
let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
running sperm whale have, in a calm, been ███████████ to the ship, and
secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
horse walks off with a ████. Again, it is very often observed that, if
the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to █████, he then ████,
not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without █████████ some ████████
indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently
open his mouth, and retain it in that dread █████████ for several
consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a
concluding ████████████; a remarkable and most significant one, by which
you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
this book ████████████ by plain facts of the present day, but that these
marvels (like all marvels) are mere ███████████ of the ages; so that for
the █████████ time we say ████ with ███████--██████ there is nothing new
under the sun.

In the sixth Christian century lived █████████, a Christian ██████████
of Constantinople, in the days when █████████ was Emperor and ██████████
general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work
every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
considered a most ███████████ and ██████████████ historian, except in
some one or two particulars, not at all █████████ the matter presently
to be mentioned.

Now, in this history of his, Procopius ████████ that, during the term
of his ██████████ at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
in the neighboring █████████, or Sea of ███████, after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot ██████ be
gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as
well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long
time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
Mediterranean and the deep waters ██████████ with it. Even now I am
certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
present ████████████ of things, a place for his ████████ gregarious
██████. But further ██████████████ have recently proved to me, that in
modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that
on the ███████ coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found
the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily ██████
through the ███████████, hence a sperm whale could, by the same █████,
pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.

In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
called ████ is to be found, the ███████ of the right whale. But I have
every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale--█████ or
██████-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,
but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its
surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
reason upon them a bit, you will ███████ perceive that, according to all
human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove
the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
whale.



CHAPTER ██. Surmises.


Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
thoughts and ███████ ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal █████████ to that one
passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
███████████ far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways, altogether to
abandon the ██████████ prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if
this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
███████████ with him. It would be ████████ too much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales, and that the more monsters he ████ by so much the more he
██████████ the chances that each ████████████ encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an ██████████ be indeed
█████████████, there were still additional considerations which, though
not so strictly according with the wildness of his ██████ passion, yet
were by no means █████████ of ███████ him.

To ██████████ his object Ahab must use █████; and of all tools used in
the shadow of the moon, men are most ███ to get out of order. He knew,
for example, that however magnetic his ██████████ in some respects was
over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority ████████ intellectual
mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a
sort of corporeal ████████. Starbuck's body and Starbuck's ███████ will
were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his ██████ at Starbuck's brain; still
he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his
captain's quest, and could he, would ████████ ████████████ himself from
it, or even █████████ it. It might be that a long interval would elapse
ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open ████████ of rebellion against his
captain's ██████████, unless some ordinary, ██████████, circumstantial
influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
insanity of Ahab ██████████ Moby Dick was ██████ more significantly
██████████ than in his ███████████ sense and ██████████ in ██████████
that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
strange imaginative ███████████ which naturally invested it; that
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the ███████
background (for few men's courage is █████ against ██████████ meditation
██████████ by action); that when they stood their long night watches,
his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby
Dick. For however eagerly and ███████████ the savage crew had hailed the
announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
██████████ and ██████████--they live in the varying outer weather, and
they ██████ its ██████████--and when retained for any object remote and
blank in the pursuit, however ██████████ of life and passion in the
end, it is above all things █████████ that temporary interests and
███████████ should █████████ and hold them █████████ suspended for the
final dash.

Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are ██████████.
The permanent ██████████████ condition of the manufactured man, thought
Ahab, is ██████████. Granting that the White Whale fully ███████ the
hearts of this my savage crew, and ███████ round their ██████████ even
██████ a certain generous knight-█████████ in them, still, while for the
love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
█████████ █████████ of old times were not content to ████████ two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy █████████, without
committing ██████████, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
███████████ by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic object--that final and romantic object, too many would have
turned from in ███████. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all
hopes of cash--aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months
go by, and no ███████████ promise of it to them, and then this same
█████████ cash all at once █████████ in them, this same cash would soon
███████ Ahab.

Nor was there wanting still another █████████████ motive more related
to Ahab personally. Having ███████████, it is probable, and perhaps
somewhat ███████████ revealed the prime but private purpose of the
Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
he had indirectly laid himself open to the ████████████ charge of
usurpation; and with ███████ ████████, both moral and █████, his crew
if so ████████, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently █████ from him the command. From
even the ██████ hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
████████████ of such a ██████████ impression gaining ground, Ahab must
of course have been most anxious to ███████ himself. That ██████████
could only ███████ in his own █████████████ brain and heart and hand,
backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
███████████ influence which it was possible for his crew to be █████████
to.

For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too ████████ to be
████████ developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's
voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
himself to ██████ all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his profession.

Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
mast-heads and ███████████ them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
█████████ even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.



CHAPTER ██. The Mat-█████.


It was a ██████, ██████ afternoon; the seamen were ██████ lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
Queequeg and I were mildly employed ███████ what is called a sword-mat,
for an additional ███████ to our boat. So still and ███████ and yet
somehow █████████ was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
invisible self.

I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I
kept passing and █████████ the filling or ████ of ███████ between
the long yarns of the ████, using my own hand for the ███████, and as
Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the ███████, and ████ looking off upon the water, carelessly and
████████████ █████ home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did
there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by
the ████████████ dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were
the ████ of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving
and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp
subject to but one single, ever returning, ██████████ vibration, and
that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise █████████████
of other threads with its own. This warp seemed █████████; and here,
thought I, with my own hand I ███ my own shuttle and weave my own
███████ into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive,
indifferent sword, sometimes ███████ the woof ██████████, or █████████,
or strongly, or ██████, as the case might be; and by this difference
in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final
aspect of the completed ██████; this savage's sword, thought I,
which thus finally ██████ and ████████ both warp and woof; this
easy, indifferent sword must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and
necessity--██████ ████████████--all ██████████████ working together.
The straight warp of necessity, not to be ███████ from its ultimate
course--its every ███████████ vibration, indeed, only tending to that;
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and
chance, though ██████████ in its play within the right lines of
necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
thus ██████████ to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
last █████████ blow at events.


Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and █████████ wild and unearthly, that the ball
of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was
that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward,
his hand stretched out like a ████, and at brief sudden intervals he
continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment
perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's
look-outs ███████ as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could
that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from
Tashtego the Indian's.

As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
prophet or ████ beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
announcing their coming.

"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"

"Where-away?"

"On the lee-████, about two miles off! a school of them!"

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whale blows as a clock █████, with the same undeviating and
reliable ██████████. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
other ██████ of his █████.

"There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
disappeared.

"Quick, steward!" cried Ahab. "Time! time!"

Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
minute to Ahab.

The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down ███████ to
leeward, we ███████████ looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
concealed beneath the surface, █████ round, and swiftly swims off in the
opposite quarter--this █████████████ of his could not now be in action;
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had
been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of
the men selected for ███████████--that is, those not █████████ to the
boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The
sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed
in their places; the ██████ were thrust out; the ████████ was backed,
and the three boats swung over the sea like three ████████ ███████ over
high ██████. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
█████ to the ████, while one foot was ███████████ ██████ on the ███████.
So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on
board an enemy's ship.

But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.



CHAPTER ██. The First Lowering.


The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
███████ and █████ of the boat which swung there. This boat had always
been deemed one of the spare boats, though ███████████ called the
captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
█████ ██████ ██████████ from its steel-like lips. A rumpled ███████
jacket of black cotton ██████████ invested him, with wide black trowsers
of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ████████ was a
glistening white ███████ ██████, the living hair braided and ██████
round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of
this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to
some of the aboriginal natives of the ████████;--a race notorious for
a certain █████████ of ████████, and by some honest white mariners
supposed to be the paid █████ and secret confidential agents on the
water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be
elsewhere.

While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers,
Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, "All ready
there, ████████?"

"Ready," was the half-hissed reply.

"Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck. "Lower away
there, I say."

Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,
goat-like, ██████ down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats
below.

Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth
keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
showed the five strangers ██████ Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern,
loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely,
so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again
riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other
boats obeyed not the command.

"Captain Ahab?--" said Starbuck.

"Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask,
pull out more to leeward!"

"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round
his great steering ███. "Lay back!" ██████████ his crew.
"There!--there!--there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!--lay
back!"

"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."

"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.
Didn't I hear 'em in the hold? And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it? What
say ye, Cabaco? They are █████████, Mr. Flask."

"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
ones," ██████████ and ██████████ ██████ Stubb to his crew, some of whom
still showed signs of uneasiness. "Why don't you break your █████████,
my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? ███! They
are only five more hands come to help us--never mind from where--the
more the ███████. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone--devils
are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that's the stroke
for a thousand ██████; that's the stroke to sweep the ██████! Hurrah
for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men--all hearts
alive! Easy, easy; don't be in a hurry--don't be in a hurry. Why don't
you snap your oars, you ███████? ████ something, you dogs! So, so, so,
then:--softly, softly! That's it--that's it! long and strong. Give way
there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ██████████ ████████████; ye are
all asleep. Stop ███████, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,
can't ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of ████████ and ██████-cakes
don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his ██████; "every mother's son
of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth. That's
it--that's it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my steel-bits.
Start her--start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-██████!"

Stubb's ████████ to his crew is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
███████████ the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
specimen of his ████████████ that he ever flew into downright ████████
with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
tone so strangely ██████████ of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a █████ to the fun, that no ███████ could hear such
queer ███████████ without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for
the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and
████████ himself, so ██████████ ███████ his steering-oar, and so ███████
█████--open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning
commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.
Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of █████████, whose jollity
is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all █████████ on their
guard in the matter of obeying them.

In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.

"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!"

"Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
spoke; still earnestly but ████████████ ██████ his crew; his face set
like a █████ from Stubb's.

"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!

"████████ on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: "A sad
business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's █████████ of sperm ahead, Mr.
Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm's the
play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand."

"Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
diverged, "as soon as I █████ eye on 'em, I thought so. Aye, and that's
what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale's at the bottom
of it. Well, well, so be it! Can't be helped! All right! Give way, men!
It ain't the White Whale to-day! Give way!"

Now the ██████ of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's
company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge
of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb's █████████ way
of ██████████ for their appearance, they were for the time █████ from
superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for
all manner of wild ███████████ as to dark Ahab's precise ██████ in the
matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious
shadows I had seen ████████ on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket
dawn, as well as the ███████████ ████████ of the unaccountable Elijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
trip-███████ they rose and fell with regular ███████ of strength, which
periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
██████ out of a ███████████ ███████. As for Fedallah, who was seen
pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
█████████ his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating ███████████ of the watery
horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
██████'s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to ██████████████ any
████████ to trip; Ahab was seen steadily ████████ his steering oar as in
a thousand boat █████████ ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once
the ████████████ arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,
while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and
crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the
rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.

"Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck. "Thou, Queequeg,
stand up!"

██████ springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
stood erect there, and with █████████ eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
stern of the boat where it was also ████████████ ██████████ level with
the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and ████████ █████████
himself to the ███████ ████████ of his ████ of a craft, and silently
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying ████████████ still; its
commander recklessly standing upon the top of the ██████████, a stout
sort of post ██████ in the keel, and rising some two feet above the
level of the stern ████████. It is used for catching turns with the
whale line. Its top is not more ████████ than the ████ of a man's hand,
and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post was
full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point
of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.

"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
that."

Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way, swiftly slid aft, and then ████████ himself ███████████ his lofty
shoulders for a ████████.

"Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?"

"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
fifty feet ██████."

Whereupon planting his feet ██████ against two opposite planks of the
boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head
and bidding him spring as he himself should ████, with one dexterous
█████ landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was
Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm ██████████ him with a
██████████ to lean against and steady himself by.

At any time it is a strange sight to the ████ to see with what wondrous
████████ of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most █████████
████████ and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him ███████
perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;
for ██████████ himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, █████████ of,
barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea ████████████
rolled his fine form. On his broad back, ██████-haired Flask seemed
a snow-█████. The ██████ looked nobler than the █████. Though truly
vivacious, tumultuous, ████████████ little Flask would now and then
█████ with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to
the negro's ██████ chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity ████████ the
living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not █████ her tides and her
seasons for that.

Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, ████████ no such far-gazing
███████████. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
███████████ interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his ███████,
where he always wore it ██████ like a ███████. He loaded it, and ██████
home the loading with his █████-end; but hardly had he ███████ his match
across the rough █████████ of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer,
whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly
dropped like light from his erect ████████ to his seat, crying out in a
quick ███████ of hurry, "Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"

To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of ████████ white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
███████████ blowing off to leeward, like the ████████ scud from white
rolling billows. The air around suddenly ████████ and ███████, as it
were, like the air over intensely ██████ ██████ of iron. Beneath this
atmospheric waving and ███████, and █████████ beneath a thin layer of
water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their ███████████
████████ and detached flying █████████.

All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air. But it ████ fair to ████████ them; it flew on and on,
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills.

"Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the ██████ possible but
█████████ ████████████ whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much
to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the
silence of the boat was at intervals ███████████ ███████ by one of his
peculiar whispers, now █████ with command, now soft with ████████.

How different the loud little King-Post. "Sing out and say something,
my hearties. Roar and pull, my ████████████! Beach me, beach me on their
black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll sign over to you my
Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.
Lay me on--lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!
See! see that white water!" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his
head, and ███████ up and down on it; then picking it up, ███████ it far
off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's
stern like a ██████ colt from the prairie.

"Look at that chap now," ███████████████ ███████ Stubb, who, with his
█████████ short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em. ███████,
merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;--merry's the word.
Pull, █████--pull, █████████--pull, all. But what the devil are you
hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and
keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
knives in two--that's all. Take it easy--why don't ye take it easy, I
say, and burst all your ██████ and lungs!"

But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious
seas may give ear to such words, when, with ███████ brow, and eyes of
red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.

Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
Flask to "that whale," as he called the ██████████ monster which
he declared to be ███████████ ███████████ his boat's bow with its
tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the ███████
must put out their eyes, and ███ a ██████ through their █████; usage
███████████ that they must have no ██████ but ears, and no limbs but
arms, in these critical moments.

It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along
the eight ████████, like gigantic █████ in a boundless ███████-green;
the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on
the knife-like edge of the ███████ waves, that almost seemed threatening
to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery █████ and
███████; the keen █████████ and ████████ to gain the top of the opposite
hill; the ████████, ████-like slide down its other side;--all these,
with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps
of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing
down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her
screaming █████;--all this was █████████.

Not the ███ ███████, marching from the bosom of his wife into the █████
heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
time finds himself pulling into the ███████, ███████ circle of the
hunted sperm whale.

The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the ███ cloud-shadows
flung upon the sea. The jets of vapour no longer blended, but ██████
everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed ██████████ their wakes.
The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales
running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still
rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be ██████ rapidly enough to
escape being torn from the row-locks.

Soon we were running through a █████████ wide veil of mist; neither ship
nor boat to be seen.

"Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet
of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
There's white water again!--close to! Spring!"

Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us ███████
that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they █████████, when
with a lightning-like ████████ whisper Starbuck said: "Stand up!" and
Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous █████████ sound as of
fifty elephants ████████ in their ██████. Meanwhile the boat was still
booming through the mist, the waves curling and ███████ around us like
the erected ██████ of enraged serpents.

"That's his hump. THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.

A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a █████; the sail
█████████ and ████████; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by;
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
crew were half ██████████ as they were tossed ██████-███████ into the
white ████████ █████ of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all
blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.

Though completely ███████, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round
it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the
water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes
the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom
of the ocean.

The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their ████████ together;
the whole squall roared, forked, and ████████ around us like a white
fire upon the prairie, in which, ██████████, we were burning; immortal
in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming ███████ as hail those
boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
The rising sea forbade all attempts to ████ out the boat. The oars were
useless as ██████████, performing now the office of life-██████████.
So, cutting the lashing of the ██████████ match ███, after many ████████
Starbuck █████████ to ██████ the lamp in the lantern; then ██████████
it on a ████ pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that ████████ candle in
the heart of that almighty ███████████. There, then, he sat, the sign
and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the
midst of despair.

Wet, ████████ through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, █████████ his hand to his ear.
We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by
the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick █████ were dimly
parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as
the ship at last ██████ into view, bearing right down upon us within a
distance of not much more than its length.

Floating on the waves we saw the █████████ boat, as for one instant it
tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a
cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed
against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on
board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from
their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us
up, but was still cruising, if █████ it might light upon some token of
our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.



CHAPTER ██. The Hyena.


There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
joke, though the ███ thereof he but dimly ████████, and more than
suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own. However,
nothing █████████, and nothing seems worth while █████████. He bolts
down all events, all ██████, and ███████, and ███████████, all hard
things visible and invisible, never mind how ██████; as an ███████ of
potent digestion ███████ down ███████ and gun ██████. And as for small
████████████ and █████████, prospects of sudden ████████, peril of
life and ████; all these, and death itself, seem to him only ███,
good-███████ ████, and jolly ███████ in the side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old █████. That odd sort of ███████ mood I am speaking
of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme ███████████; it comes
in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might
have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the
general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this
free and easy sort of genial, █████████ philosophy; and with it I now
regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its
object.

"Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
"Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?"
Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to
understand that such things did often happen.

"Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb, I
think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a █████
squall is the height of a whaleman's ██████████?"

"Certain. I've lowered for whales from a ███████ ship in a gale off Cape
Horn."

"Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell
me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death's
jaws?"

"Can't you █████ that smaller?" said Flask. "Yes, that's the law.
I should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them ██████ for squint, mind
that!"

Here then, from three █████████ █████████, I had a deliberate statement
of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and ██████████
in the water and ██████████ █████████ on the deep, were matters
of common ██████████ in this kind of life; considering that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must ██████ my
life into the hands of him who steered the boat--oftentimes a fellow who
at that very moment is in his █████████████ upon the point of █████████
the craft with his own frantic █████████; considering that the
particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be ███████
to Starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,
and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his
great ███████████ in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this
uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a
devil's chase I was ██████████, touching the White Whale: taking all
things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a
rough █████ of my will. "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my
██████, ████████, and ███████."

It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be █████████ at their
last █████ and ██████████, but there are no people in the world more
████ of that █████████. This was the fourth time in my nautical life
that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon
the present occasion, I felt all the ██████; a stone was rolled away
from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good
as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a █████████████
clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived
myself; my death and ██████ were locked up in my chest. I looked
round me tranquilly and ███████████, like a quiet ghost with a clean
conscience sitting inside the ████ of a snug family vault.

Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my █████,
here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
devil fetch the ████████.



CHAPTER ██. Ahab's Boat and Crew. Fedallah.


"Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb; "if I had but one leg
you would not █████ me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
with my timber ███. Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"

"I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said Flask.
"If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.
That would ███████ him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
left, you know."

"I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him █████."


Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is
right for a whaling captain to ██████████ that life in the active perils
of the chase. So █████████'s soldiers often argued with tears in their
eyes, whether that ██████████ life of his ought to be carried into the
thickest of the fight.

But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any
██████ man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the
joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.

Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually
███████████ to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above all for
Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat's
crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not █████████ a boat's
crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
Nevertheless he had taken private ████████ of his own touching all
that matter. Until Cabaco's █████████ discovery, the sailors had little
████████ it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out
of port, all hands had concluded the customary business of ███████ the
██████████ for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
found ██████████ himself in the matter of making █████-pins with his
own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
████████████ cutting the small wooden ███████, which when the line is
running out are ██████ over the ██████ in the bow: when all this was
observed in him, and particularly his ██████████ in having an extra
coat of █████████ in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly ███████ the █████ board, or clumsy █████, as it is
sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the
knee against in darting or ████████ at the whale; when it was observed
how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
████-circular ██████████ in the cleat, and with the carpenter's ██████
██████ out a little here and ████████████ it a little there; all these
things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
almost everybody supposed that this particular ███████████ heedfulness
in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick;
for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster
in person. But such a ███████████ did by no means ███████ the remotest
suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat.

Now, with the ███████████ phantoms, what wonder remained soon █████
away; for in a whaler wonders soon ████. Besides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
█████████ himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain, and it would not ██████ any ███████████
██████████ in the forecastle.

But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained
a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a ████████ world like
this, by what sort of unaccountable ███ he soon evinced himself to be
linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot ███████
an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as
civilized, domestic people in the █████████ zone only see in their
dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then █████
among the unchanging ███████ ███████████, especially the Oriental isles
to the east of the continent--those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
███████ ██████████████ of earth's primal generations, when the memory of
the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his ███████████,
█████████ whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of
the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when though,
according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
men, the devils also, add the ███████████ ███████, ████████ in mundane
██████.



CHAPTER ██. The Spirit-Spout.


Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the
Cape de ██████; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the
███ de la █████; and the ██████ Ground, an ████████, watery ████████,
█████████ from St. ██████.

It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like ███████ of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing █████████, made what seemed a ███████
silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it
looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred
would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions,
then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual
hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after
spending his uniform interval there for several ██████████ nights
without ████████ a single sound; when, after all this silence, his
unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every
reclining mariner started to his feet as if some ██████ spirit had
lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. "There she blows!"
Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have ████████ more; yet
still they felt no terror; rather ████████. For though it was a most
unwonted hour, yet so ██████████ was the cry, and so deliriously
████████, that almost every soul on board █████████████ desired a
lowering.

Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
t'gallant sails and ██████ to be set, and every ████████ spread. The
best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,
█████████, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
of so many sails, made the ███████, hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two ████████████
influences were ██████████ in her--one to mount direct to heaven, the
other to drive ████████ to some horizontal ████. And had you ███████
Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively ██████
along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-███.
On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly
████, and though from every eye, like ██████, the eager glances shot,
yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore he
saw it once, but not a second time.

This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
was descried by all; but upon making sail to ████████ it, once more it
disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously
██████ into the clear moonlight, or █████████, as the case might be;
████████████ again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow
seeming at every distinct ██████████ to be advancing still further and
further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever ████████ us on.

Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in ██████████
with the █████████████████, as it seemed, which in many things invested
the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
far apart latitudes and longitudes, that ██████████ spout was cast
by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition,
as if it were █████████████ █████████ us on and on, in order that the
monster might turn round upon us, and ████ us at last in the remotest
and most savage seas.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath
all its blue █████████, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as
for days and days we ███████ along, through seas so ███████, ██████████
mild, that all space, in repugnance to our ████████ errand, seemed
████████ itself of life before our ███-like prow.

But, at last, when turning to the ████████, the Cape winds began howling
around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are
there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and
█████ the dark waves in her madness, till, like ███████ of silver chips,
the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate ███████
of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.

Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-██████. And
every morning, perched on our █████, rows of these birds were seen; and
spite of our ████████, for a long time ███████████ clung to the ████,
as though they deemed our ship some ████████, ███████████ craft; a thing
appointed to desolation, and therefore fit ████████-place for their
████████ ██████. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the
black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane
soul were in anguish and ███████ for the long sin and █████████ it had
bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape ██████████, as called
of ████; for long ███████ by the ██████████ ████████ that before had
attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea,
where guilty beings ███████████ into those fowls and these fish, seemed
condemned to swim on █████████████ without any haven in store, or beat
that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and █████████;
still █████████ its fountain of ████████ to the sky; still beckoning us
on from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried.

During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the
time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,
manifested the █████████ ███████; and more seldom than ever addressed
his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and
aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but █████████ to █████
the █████ of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical █████████.
So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one
hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand
gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow
would all but ███████ his very █████████ together. Meantime, the crew
driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that
██████████ broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in
the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man
had slipped himself into a sort of ███████ secured to the rail, in which
he swung as in a ████████ belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the
silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore
on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the
ocean █████████; still in silence the men swung in the ████████; still
████████ Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed
█████████ repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never
could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night going down
into the cabin to mark how the █████████ stood, he saw him with
closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain
and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
emerged, still slowly ████████ from the █████████ hat and coat. On the
table beside him lay ████████ one of those charts of tides and currents
which have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly
clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so
that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-████
that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*


*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can ██████ himself of the
course of the ship.


Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
gale, still thou steadfastly █████ thy purpose.



CHAPTER ██. The Albatross.


South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant ████████, a good cruising
ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)
by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.

As if the waves had been ███████, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this ████████
appearance was ██████ with long ████████ of ████████ rust, while all her
spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees ██████ over
with ████-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to
see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed
████ in the █████ of beasts, so torn and █████████ the ███████ that had
survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to
the mast, they swayed and swung over a ██████████ sea; and though, when
the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air
came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the
mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking
fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.

"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?"

But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the
act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand
into the sea; and the wind now rising █████, he in vain strove to make
himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the
distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod
were ████████ their ██████████ of this ominous incident at the first
mere mention of the White Whale's name to another ship, Ahab for a
moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking
█████████ of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and
knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and
shortly bound home, he loudly hailed--"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod,
bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the
Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them
to address them to--"

At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
that for some days before had been ████████ swimming by our side, darted
away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and
aft with the stranger's flanks. Though in the course of his continual
█████████ Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to
any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles ████████████ carry meanings.

"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
████████ sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But
turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the
wind to ████████ her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,--"Up
helm! Keep her off round the world!"

Round the world! There is much in that sound to ███████ proud feelings;
but ███████ does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
we left behind secure, were all the time before us.

Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new █████████, and discover sights more sweet and strange
than any ████████ or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
either lead us on in barren █████ or ██████ leave us ███████.



CHAPTER ██. The ███.


The ██████████ reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened ██████. But even had
this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it
had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a ████████
answer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he
cared not to ███████, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,
except he could ██████████ some of that ███████████ he so ███████████
sought. But all this might remain ████████████ █████████, were not
something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when
meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common
cruising-ground.

If two strangers crossing the Pine ███████ in New York State, or the
███████ desolate █████████ Plain in England; if ████████ encountering
each other in such ████████████ █████, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual ██████████; and stopping for a moment
to ███████████ the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while
and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
███████████ Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off lone
Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more natural,
I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
interchange █████, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,
officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other;
and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.

For the long absent ship, the outward-███████, perhaps, has letters on
board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
████ a year or two later than the last one on her ███████ and thumb-worn
█████. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would
receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to
which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And
in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing
each other's track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they
are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received a
████████ of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and
some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now █████.
Besides, they would ████████ the whaling news, and have an █████████
chat. For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,
but likewise with all the peculiar ██████████████ arising from a common
pursuit and mutually shared ██████████ and perils.

Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of
English whalers, such ████████ do not very often █████, and when they
do occur there is too apt to be a sort of ███████ between them; for your
██████████ is rather reserved, and your ██████, he does not fancy that
sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American
whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his ███████████
██████████████, as a sort of sea-███████. But where this superiority
in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,
seeing that the Yankees in one day, ████████████, kill more whales than
all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless
little ██████ in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does
not take much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few
███████ himself.

So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so. Whereas, some
merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of ███████ in
Broadway; and all the time █████████, perhaps, in ███████ █████████ upon
each other's rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea,
they first go through such a string of silly ███████ and █████████, such
a ███████ of ███████, that there does not seem to be much right-down
hearty good-will and █████████ love about it at all. As touching
Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run
away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they
chance to cross each other's cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many
██████?"--the same way that whalers hail--"How many barrels?" And that
question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are
infernal ████████ on both sides, and don't like to see ████████ of each
other's villanous ██████████.

But look at the godly, honest, ██████████████, hospitable, sociable,
free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a "GAM," a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and
██████ gamesome stuff about "████████" and "blubber-███████," and such
like pretty ████████████. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also
all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such
a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be
hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to
know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about
it. It sometimes ends in uncommon █████████, indeed; but only at the
gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has
no proper ██████████ for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude,
that in ████████ himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that
assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.

But what is a GAM? You might wear out your █████-finger running up and
down the columns of ████████████, and never find the word. ██. Johnson
never attained to that █████████; Noah Webster's ark does not hold it.
Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in
constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly,
it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the ███████. With
that view, let me █████████ define it.

GAM. ████--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) ██████████, GENERALLY ON A
CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY
BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON BOARD OF ONE
SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.

There is another little item about ███████ which must not be forgotten
here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of ██████; so
has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when
the captain is █████ anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
sheets on a comfortable, sometimes █████████ seat there, and often
██████ himself with a pretty little ████████'s tiller █████████ with
gay cords and ███████. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no ████ of
that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling
captains were ███████ about the water on castors like █████ old ████████
in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of
any such ██████████; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew
must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of
the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and
the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit
all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being
conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the
importance of sustaining his dignity by ███████████ his legs. Nor is
this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
after-oar █████████████ by ███████ his knees in front. He is thus
completely ██████ before and behind, and can only expand himself
sideways by ████████ down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to ██████ him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,
it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would
never do, I say, for this ██████████ captain to be seen █████████
himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with
his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being
generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ███████.
Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well █████████████ ones too,
where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or
two, in a sudden squall say--to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's
hair, and hold on there like grim death.



CHAPTER ██. The Town-Ho's Story.


(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)


The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet
more travellers than in any other part.

It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned
almost wholly by ███████████. In the short gam that ensued she gave
us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White
Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho's
story, which seemed █████████ to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous, inverted ██████████ of one of those so called █████████ of God
which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance,
with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the
secret part of the tragedy about to be ████████, never reached the ears
of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was
unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private
property of three ███████████ white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it
seems, ████████████ it to Tashtego with Romish ███████████ of ███████,
but the following night Tashtego ███████ in his sleep, and revealed
so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well
████████ the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing
have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of
it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they ████████ in
this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
██████████ █████ the Pequod's main-mast. ████████████ in its proper
place this darker ██████ with the story as ████████ narrated on the
ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on ███████
record.


*The ancient whale-cry upon first ████████ a whale from the mast-head,
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous ██████████ ████████.


For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated
it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve,
smoking upon the thick-████ █████ ██████ of the Golden Inn. Of those
fine █████████, the young ████, █████ and █████████, were on the closer
terms with me; and hence the ███████████ questions they occasionally
put, and which are duly answered at the time.

"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
██████████ to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward
from the █████ of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the
northward of the Line. One morning upon ████████ the pumps, according to
daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than
common. They supposed a sword-fish had ███████ her, gentlemen. But the
captain, having some unusual reason for █████████ that rare good luck
███████ him in those latitudes; and therefore being very ██████ to quit
them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,
indeed, they could not find it after █████████ the hold as low down
as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her
█████████, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals;
but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet
undiscovered, but it ████████ increased. So much so, that now taking
some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest
harbor among the islands, there to have his hull ████ out and ████████.

"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the █████████ chance
████████, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,
because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at
them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;
never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the
whole of this passage being attended by very ██████████ breezes, the
Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port
without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the
██████ overbearing of ██████, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly
████████ vengeance of █████████, a ███████ and desperado from Buffalo.

"'Lakeman!--Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'
said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

"On the eastern shore of our Lake ████, Don; but--I █████ your
courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-██████ ships, well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old ██████ to far
███████; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet
been nurtured by all those ████████ ███████████ impressions popularly
connected with the open ocean. For in their ████████████ aggregate,
those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and ███████, and █████, and
Superior, and ████████,--possess an ocean-like █████████████, with many
of the ocean's ███████ ██████; with many of its ██████ varieties of
█████ and of climes. They ███████ round archipelagoes of romantic isles,
even as the ██████████ waters do; in large part, are ██████ by two great
contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime
██████████ to our numerous ███████████ colonies from the East, dotted
all round their banks; here and there are ███████ upon by █████████,
and by the goat-like ██████ guns of lofty ████████; they have heard the
fleet ███████████ of naval █████████; at intervals, they yield their
beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out
their ██████ ███████; for leagues and leagues are ███████ by ancient
and █████████ forests, where the gaunt pines stand like ███████ lines
of kings in Gothic ███████████; those same woods █████████ wild █████
beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose ████████ ████ give robes
to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved ████████ of Buffalo and
█████████, as well as █████████ villages; they float alike the
full-██████ merchant ship, the armed ███████ of the State, the steamer,
and the beech canoe; they are swept by ██████ and ██████████ ██████ as
direful as any that ████ the salted wave; they know what ██████████ are,
for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many
a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though
an ████████, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;
as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his
infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse
at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our
███████ Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as
vengeful and full of social ███████ as the █████████ seaman, fresh
from the latitudes of ████-horn handled █████-knives. Yet was this
Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by ██████████
████████, only ████████ by that common ███████ of human recognition
which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had
long been retained harmless and ██████. At all events, he had proved
so thus far; but Radney was ██████ and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,
gentlemen, you shall hear.

"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing
her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again
increasing, but only so as to ███████ an hour or more at the pumps
every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
Atlantic, for example, some ████████ think little of ███████ their whole
way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of
the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on
account of all hands gently █████████ to the bottom. Nor in the
solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it
altogether unusual for ships to keep ████████ at their pump-handles in
full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie
along a tolerably ██████████ coast, or if any other reasonable retreat
is ████████ them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of
the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her
captain begins to feel a little anxious.

"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded
the upper sails to be well ███████, sheeted home anew, and every way
expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a
coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless, ██████████ creature on land or
on sea that you can ████████████ imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when
he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in
her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on
this head no small gamesomeness █████ going on among them, as they stood
with their feet continually ██████████ by the ████████ clear water;
clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that ████████ from the pumps
ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
███████-holes.

"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this ████████████
world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of ███████, straightway against that man he
█████████ an unconquerable ███████ and ██████████; and if he have a
chance he will pull down and █████████ that subaltern's tower, and
make a little ████ of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,
gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the ████████ housings
of your last ███████'s ████████ charger; and a brain, and a heart, and
a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt ███████████, had he
been born son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly
as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love
Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.

"███████ the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but ██████, went on with
his gay ██████████.

"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a ████████, one
of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth ████████! I tell
ye what, men, old ███'s ██████████ must go for it! he had best cut away
his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish
only began the job; he's come back again with a ████ of ship-carpenters,
saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole █████ of 'em
are now hard at work cutting and ████████ at the bottom; making
improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump
overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his ██████, I
can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,
they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I
wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'

"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'

"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys,
lively, now!' And with that the pump ███████ like fifty fire-███████;
the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar ███████
of the lungs was heard which ███████ the fullest ███████ of life's
utmost ████████.

"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
forward all ███████, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and ██████ the ███████ sweat from his
brow. Now what ████████ █████ it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney
to ██████ with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know
not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
██████, and remove some █████████ matters consequent upon ████████ a pig
to run at large.

"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the █████████████ of
sea-usages and the ███████████ love of ████████ in seamen; some of whom
would not willingly drown without first ███████ their faces. But in all
vessels this broom business is the ████████████ ████████ of the boys,
if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho
that had been divided into █████, taking turns at the pumps; and being
the most ████████ seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly
assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have
been freed from any ███████ business not connected with truly nautical
duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these
particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood
between the two men.

"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat
in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully
comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for
a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's █████████ eye and
perceived the ██████ of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match
silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all
this, that strange ███████████ and █████████████ to stir up the deeper
██████████████ in any already ██████ being--a repugnance most felt, when
felt at all, by really valiant men even when █████████--this nameless
phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.

"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
██████████ he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without
at all ████████ to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary
████████; who, not being ████████ at the pumps, had done little or
nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most
███████████ and outrageous manner ███████████████ ███████████ his
command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an
uplifted cooper's ████ hammer which he had ████████ from a cask near by.

"Heated and █████████ as he was by his █████████ toil at the pumps, for
all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the ████████ Steelkilt
could but ill █████ this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
██████████ the █████████████ within him, without speaking he remained
████████ rooted to his seat, till at last the ████████ Radney shook the
hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
his bidding.

"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed by the mate with his ████████ hammer, deliberately repeated his
intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not
the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable ██████████ with his
twisted hand he ██████ off the foolish and ██████████ man; but it was to
no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;
when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had
now ████████ as much as █████████ with his humor, the Lakeman paused on
the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
his teeth; meanwhile █████████ a string of insufferable maledictions.
Retreating not the ██████████ part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
with the ███████████ ███████ of his glance, Steelkilt, █████████
his right hand behind him and ██████████ drawing it back, told his
██████████ that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would
murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the █████████
by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whale.

"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the █████████
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
█████████. They were both █████████.

"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro. 'We have seen many whale-ships in our
████████, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
they?'

"'Canallers, Don, are the ███████ belonging to our grand Erie █████. You
must have heard of it.'

"'Nay, █████; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'

"'Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your ██████'s very fine; and
ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
information may throw side-light upon my story.'

"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
breadth of the state of New York; through numerous ████████ cities and
most ████████ villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited ██████, and
████████, ██████████ fields, ██████████ for █████████; by ████████-room
and bar-room; through the holy-of-██████ of great forests; on Roman
arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble ██████
████████; and especially, by rows of snow-white ███████, whose spires
stand almost like ██████████, flows one continual stream of ██████████
corrupt and often lawless life. There's your true ████████, gentlemen;
there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
under the long-flung shadow, and the snug ███████████ lee of churches.
For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
███████████ that they ever ██████ around the halls of justice, so
sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest ██████████.

"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
███████ ██████, with humorous concern.

"'Well for our northern friend, ████ ████████'s ███████████ █████ in
Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian. 'Proceed, Senor.'

"'A moment! Pardon!' cried another of the company. 'In the name of all
us ███████, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima
for distant ██████ in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast--"Corrupt as
Lima." It but bears out your saying, too; churches more █████████ than
billiard-tables, and for ever open--and "Corrupt as Lima." So, too,
Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
Mark!--St. ███████, █████ it! Your cup! ██████: here I refill; now, you
pour out again.'

"Freely ████████ in his own vocation, gentlemen, the ████████ would make
a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and █████████████ wicked is he. Like
Mark ██████, for days and days along his green-██████, flowery ████,
he indolently floats, openly ██████ with his red-cheeked █████████,
████████ his ███████ thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this
effeminacy is dashed. The ██████████ guise which the Canaller so proudly
██████; his slouched and █████-████████ hat ███████ his grand features.
A terror to the ███████ innocence of the villages through which he
floats; his swart ██████ and bold ███████ are not █████████ in cities.
Once a ████████ on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of
these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ██████████;
but it is often one of the prime █████████ qualities of your man of
violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
in a strait, as to plunder a ███████ one. In sum, gentlemen, what the
wildness of this canal life is, is ████████████ evinced by this; that
our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished █████████,
and that scarce any race of mankind, except ██████ men, are so much
distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the
███████████ of this matter, that to many thousands of our █████ boys and
young men born along its line, the ████████████ life of the Grand Canal
furnishes the sole transition between quietly ███████ in a Christian
corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric
seas.

"'I see! I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, ████████ his chicha
upon his silvery ███████. 'No need to travel! The world's one Lima. I
had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold
and holy as the hills.--But the story.'

"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the ████████. Hardly
had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three ██████ mates and the
four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the
ropes like ███████ ██████, the two Canallers rushed into the ██████, and
sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the
sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted ███████ ensued;
while standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain ██████ up and down
with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to █████████ that █████████
█████████, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran
close up to the revolving ██████ of the confusion, and prying into
the heart of it with his pike, sought to █████ out the object of his
resentment. But Steelkilt and his ███████████ were too much for them
all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, ███████
███████ about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,
these sea-█████████ ██████████ themselves behind the █████████.

"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. 'Come
out of that, ye cut-███████!'

"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
██████ the █████ the ███████ could do; but gave the captain to
understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the ██████
for a murderous ██████ on the part of all hands. ███████ in his heart
lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little ████████, but
still commanded the ██████████ instantly to return to their duty.

"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their
██████████.

"'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty! Do you want to
sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!' and he
once more raised a pistol.

"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt. 'Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say
ye, men?' turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their ████████.

"The Lakeman now █████████ the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
on the Captain, and jerking out such █████████ as these:--'It's not our
█████; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to
prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his
cursed jaw; ain't those ███████ knives down in the forecastle there,
men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to
yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all; we are ready
to turn to; treat us ████████, and we're your men; but we won't be
███████.'

"'Turn to! I make no ████████, turn to, I say!'

"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can █████ our
█████████ as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's
not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
won't be flogged.'

"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.

"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you what
it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.'

"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till
ye're sick of it. Down ye go.'

"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they ████████ him down
into their dark den, ██████████ disappearing, like bears into a cave.

"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy █████ ███████ belonging to the
████████████.

"Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something
down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in
number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained
neutral.

"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore ████████; at which
last place it was ██████ the insurgents might emerge, after breaking
through the ████████ below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace;
the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps,
whose ████████ and ████████ at intervals through the dreary night
dismally █████████ through the ship.

"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
the █████████ to work; but with a ████ they ███████. Water was then
lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
after it; when again turning the key upon them and █████████ it, the
Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days
this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused █████████, and
then a █████████ was heard, as the customary ███████ was █████████; and
suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready
to turn to. The █████ █████████ of the air, and a █████████ ████, united
perhaps to some fears of ultimate ███████████, had constrained them to
█████████ at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain ██████████ his
demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to
stop his ████████ and ██████ himself where he belonged. On the fifth
morning three others of the █████████ bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.

"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless ████.

"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.

"'Oh certainly,' said the Captain, and the key ███████.

"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the █████████ of seven
of his former ██████████, and █████ by the ███████ voice that had last
hailed him, and maddened by his long ██████████ in a place as black as
the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two
Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of
their hole at the next summoning of the ████████; and armed with their
keen mincing knives (long, ██████████, heavy ██████████ with a handle
at each end) run █████ from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
████████████ of ███████████ possible, seize the ship. For himself, he
would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the
last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no
██████████ on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for
that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.
And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck,
when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as
fiercely ████████, █████████ that priority for himself; particularly as
his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter;
and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one
man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these ██████████
must come out.

"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
of █████████, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit.
But when Steelkilt made known his █████████████ still to lead them to
the last, they in some way, by some subtle █████████ of ███████, mixed
their before secret ███████████ together; and when their leader
fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three
sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and ██████ him with cords;
and ████████ out for the Captain at midnight.

"Thinking murder at hand, and ████████ in the dark for the blood, he and
all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a
few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
██████, who at once ███████ the honour of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murder. But all these were ████████, and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
morning. 'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
'the ████████ would not touch ye, ye villains!'

"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had ████████
from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that
he had a good mind to ████ them all round--thought, upon the whole,
he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for the present,
considering their ██████ surrender, he would let them go with a
█████████, which he accordingly ████████████ in the ██████████.

"'But as for you, ye carrion ██████,' turning to the three men in the
rigging--'for you, I mean to █████ ye up for the try-pots;' and,
seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two ████████, till they yelled no more, but ██████████ hung their heads
sideways, as the two █████████ thieves are drawn.

"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is still
rope enough left for you, my fine ██████, that wouldn't give up. Take
that ███ from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.'

"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a █████████ motion of his
███████ jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort
of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me, I murder
you!'

"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off with
the rope to strike.

"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.

"'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.

"Steelkilt here hissed out something, █████████ to all but the Captain;
who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly
two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, 'I
won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'

"But as the junior mates were hurrying to ███████ the order, a pale man,
with a ████████ head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate. Ever since
the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult
on the deck, he had █████ out, and thus far had watched the whole
scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak;
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the
captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his
████████ foe.

"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.

"'So I am, but take that.' The mate was in the very act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing
no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat, whatever that
might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned
to, and, ████████ worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as
before.

"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a ██████
was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
████████ the cabin door, saying they █████ not consort with the crew.
██████████, █████, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation. Still, no
sign of mutiny ██████████ among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
that ██████ at Steelkilt's ███████████, they had resolved to maintain
the strictest ████████████, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to ██████ the
█████████ end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing--namely,
not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to
lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale.

"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to █████ this sort of
███████████ in their conduct, he kept his own ███████ (at least till all
was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
had stung him in the ██████████ of his heart. He was in Radney the chief
mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than
half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,
against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head
of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances,
Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

"During the night, Radney had an ████████████ way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.
In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes █████. There was a
considerable ███████ between the boat and the ship, and down between
this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next
trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the
third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his ███████,
he employed the interval in ████████ something very carefully in his
watches below.

"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.

"'What do you think? what does it look like?'

"'Like a ███████ for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'

"'Yes, rather ██████,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
before him; 'but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven't enough
twine,--have you any?'

"But there was none in the forecastle.

"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.

"'You don't mean to go a ███████ to HIM!' said a sailor.

"'Why not? Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself
in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at him
quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night
an iron ball, closely ██████, partly rolled from the pocket of the
Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was ███████ the coat into his hammock for
a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm--nigh
to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to
the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
fore-█████████ soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
stretched as a ██████, with his forehead crushed in.

"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be ████████ from the bloody
deed he had ███████. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
███████. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the ███████ thing he would have
done.

"It was just between ████████ and sunrise of the morning of the second
day, when they were washing down the decks, that a ██████ █████████ man,
drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, 'There she
rolls! there she rolls!' ████, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.

"'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do
whales have ████████████? Whom call you Moby Dick?'

"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;--but
that would be too long a story.'

"'How? how?' cried all the young █████████, ████████.

"'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay! I cannot ████████ that now. Let me get more
into the air, ████.'

"'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks
faint;--fill up his empty glass!'

"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen,
so suddenly ██████████ the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
ship--█████████ of the ███████ among the crew--in the excitement of the
moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from captain, mates,
and harpooneers, who, ██████████ by fearful ███████, were all anxious
to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the ██████ crew eyed
███████, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
that lit up by a horizontal █████████ sun, shifted and glistened like
a living ████ in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality
████████ the whole career of these events, as if verily ██████ out
before the world itself was ███████. The mutineer was the ███████ of the
mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while
Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and ████ in or ███████
the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were
lowered, the mate's got the start; and none howled more fiercely with
delight than did Steelkilt, as he ████████ at his oar. After a stiff
pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to
the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his
bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's ███████ back. Nothing
loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a ████████ foam that
█████ two ███████████ together; till of a sudden the boat struck as
against a sunken ledge, and ███████ over, spilled out the standing mate.
That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat ███████,
and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the
sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray,
and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to
remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round
in a sudden maelstrom; seized the ███████ between his jaws; and rearing
high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.

"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had
█████████ the line, so as to drop astern from the █████████; calmly
looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,
downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He
cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose
again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the
teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the
whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary
place--where no civilized creature ███████. There, headed by the
Lakeman, all but five or six of the ███████████ deliberately deserted
among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.

"The ship's company being ███████ to but a handful, the captain called
upon the Islanders to ██████ him in the █████████ business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leak. But to such █████████ vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites ████████████, both
by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they █████████,
that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
████████ condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
from the bows; ███████ his muskets on the ████; and ███████ the
Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to ███████ a
█████████████ to his crew.

"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed
to have touched at a low isle of ██████. He steered away from it; but
the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt
hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain
presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the █████ war-canoes,
the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; ████████ him that if the pistol so
much as clicked in the lock, he would ████ him in bubbles and foam.

"'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.

"'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded Steelkilt;
'no lies.'

"'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'

"'Very good. Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.' With that he
leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood
face to face with the captain.

"'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me.
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike
me!'

"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman. '█████, Senor!' and leaping
into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

"Watching the boat till it was fairly ███████, and drawn up to the
█████ of the █████-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time
arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck ██████████
him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were ██████████████
in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They
embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he
been at all minded to work them legal retribution.

"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
█████████, who had been somewhat used to the sea. ██████████ a small
native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisings.

"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which ███████
to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him.

"'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.

"'I am, Don.'

"'Then I ███████ you, tell me if to the best of your own ███████████,
this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful!
Did you get it from an unquestionable ██████? Bear with me if I seem to
press.'

"'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.

"'Is there a copy of the Holy ███████████ in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?'

"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who
will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well ███████?
this may grow too serious.'

"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'

"'Though there are no ████-██-██'s in Lima now,' said one of the company
to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the ███████████████.
Let us ████████ more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.'

"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
that you will be particular in █████████ the largest sized Evangelists
you can.'

"'This is the priest, he ██████ you the Evangelists,' said Don Sebastian,
███████, returning with a tall and solemn figure.

"'Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light,
and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.

"'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,
gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be
true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have
seen and ██████ with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"



CHAPTER ██. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.


I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
It may be worth while, therefore, previously to ██████ to those
curious █████████ █████████ of him which even down to the present day
confidently █████████ the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the
world right in this matter, by ███████ such pictures of the whale all
wrong.

It may be that the primal source of all those █████████ █████████ will
be found among the oldest ██████, Egyptian, and ███████ ██████████. For
ever since those █████████ but ████████████ times when on the marble
██████████ of ███████, the █████████ of ███████, and on ███████,
██████████, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
█████-armor like ███████'s, and a helmeted head like St. George's; ever
since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
█████████████ of him.

Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant ████████ anyways ██████████ to
be the whale's, is to be found in the famous ██████-pagoda of Elephanta,
in India. The ████████ maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and ████████, every conceivable
█████████ of man, were ██████████ ages before any of them actually came
into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of
whaling should have been there ████████ forth. The Hindoo whale
referred to, ██████ in a separate department of the wall, █████████ the
incarnation of ██████ in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the
█████ ██████. But though this █████████ is half man and half whale, so
as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small ███████ of him is
all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the
broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.

But go to the old █████████, and look now at a great Christian painter's
portrait of this fish; for he ████████ no better than the ████████████
Hindoo. It is █████'s picture of Perseus ████████ █████████ from the
sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange
creature as that? Nor does ███████, in painting the same scene in his
own "Perseus Descending," make out one ████ better. The huge ██████████
of that ██████████ monster █████████ on the surface, scarcely drawing
one inch of water. It has a sort of ██████ on its back, and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be
taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the
Tower. Then, there are the █████████ whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and
Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old ██████ and the ████ of
old ███████. What shall be said of these? As for the book-██████'s whale
winding like a ████-█████ round the stock of a descending anchor--as
stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both
old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
████████, I take it, from the like ███████ on antique █████.
Though ███████████ denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this
book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended
when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old
███████ █████████ somewhere about the ████ century, during the ███████
of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively
late period, ████████ were popularly supposed to be a species of the
Leviathan.

In the █████████ and other ██████████████ of some ancient books you will
at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner
of spouts, jets d'███, hot springs and cold, ████████ and █████-Baden,
come bubbling up from his ███████████ brain. In the title-page of the
original ███████ of the "███████████ of Learning" you will find some
curious whales.

But quitting all these ██████████████ attempts, let us glance at those
pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific ████████████,
by those who know. In old Harris's ██████████ of voyages there are some
plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the
Whale, Peter ████████ of █████████, master." In one of those plates the
whales, like great █████ of logs, are ███████████ lying among ice-isles,
with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
flukes.

Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,
a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round Cape Horn
into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
Fisheries." In this book is an outline purporting to be a "Picture of
a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by █████ from one killed on the
coast of Mexico, August, ████, and hoisted on deck." I doubt not the
captain had this █████████ picture taken for the ███████ of his marines.
To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which
applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm
whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet
long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out
of that eye!

Nor are the most conscientious ████████████ of Natural History for
the benefit of the young and ██████, free from the same ███████████ of
mistake. Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature." In the
abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged "whale"
and a "narwhale." I do not wish to seem █████████, but this █████████
whale looks much like an █████████ sow; and, as for the narwhale, one
glimpse at it is enough to █████ one, that in this nineteenth century
such a ██████████ could be palmed for ███████ upon any intelligent
public of schoolboys.

Then, again, in ████, ███████ ███████, Count de Lacepede, a great
naturalist, published a scientific ██████████ whale book, wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these
are not only █████████, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland
whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
counterpart in nature.

But the placing of the cap-█████ to all this ██████████ business was
reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he
gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that
picture to any Nantucketer, you had best ███████ for your summary
retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not
a Sperm Whale, but a ██████. Of course, he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific ███████████
in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic █████████; that
is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil
those Chinese are, many queer cups and ███████ inform us.

As for the sign-████████' whales seen in the streets hanging over the
█████ of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
Richard III. whales, with █████████ █████, and very savage; ████████████
on three or four sailor █████, that is whaleboats full of mariners:
their ███████████ ███████████ in seas of blood and blue paint.

But these ████████ ████████ in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific ████████ have
been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a ███████ ship, with broken back, would correctly █████████
the noble animal itself in all its ████████ pride of hull and spars.
Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan
has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,
in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,
like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a
thing eternally impossible for mortal man to █████ him bodily into the
air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and ███████████. And, not
to speak of the ██████ ██████████ difference of ███████ between a young
sucking whale and a full-grown █████████ Leviathan; yet, even in the
case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such
is then the outlandish, eel-like, ████████, varying shape of him, that
his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.

But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale, ████████ hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all.
For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that
his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though ██████
███████'s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the ███████ of one of
his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a █████-browed utilitarian
old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal ███████████████;
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's
███████████ bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton
of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and ██████
animal as the insect does to the █████████ that so ██████████ █████████
it. This peculiarity is ██████████ evinced in the head, as in some
part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously
displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to
the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four
regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But
all these are ███████████ lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
fingers in an artificial covering. "However recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be truly
said to handle us without ███████."

For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain █████████ to the last. True, one portrait may hit
the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of █████████. So there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is
by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had
best not be too ██████████ in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.



CHAPTER ██. Of the Less █████████ Pictures of Whales, and the True
Pictures of Whaling Scenes.


In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of
them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
that matter by.

I know of only four published ████████ of the great Sperm Whale;
Colnett's, ███████'s, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's. In the previous
chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins's is far
better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale's is the best. All Beale's
drawings of this whale are good, █████████ the middle figure in the
picture of three whales in various attitudes, ███████ his second
chapter. His ████████████, boats █████████ Sperm Whales, though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil ██████████ of some parlor men, is
█████████ correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm
Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they
are ██████████ ████████. That is not his fault though.

Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
are drawn on too small a scale to ██████ a █████████ impression. He has
but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad ██████████, because
it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive
anything like a ████████ idea of the living whale as seen by his living
hunters.

But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found, are two large French ██████████, well ████████,
and taken from █████████ by one ███████. Respectively, they represent
attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first █████████ a noble
Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just █████ beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the ██████ planks. The prow of
the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon
the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
████████████ flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a █████████. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true. The half-███████ line-███ floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely ███ in it; the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not
draw so good a one.

In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some █████ rock-slide from the Patagonian
cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like ████; so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave
supper ███████ in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are ███████ at the
small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea ███████ and █████████, which the
Right Whale sometimes carries on his █████████ back. And all the while
the thick-██████ leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving ████ of
tumultuous white curds in his wake, and ███████ the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
steamer. Thus, the ██████████ is all raging commotion; but behind, in
admirable ████████ contrast, is the glassy level of a sea ████████, the
████████ ██████████ sails of the █████████ ship, and the inert mass of
a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily
hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.

Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
was either practically ██████████ with his subject, or else ████████████
███████ by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for
painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and
where will you find such a ███████ of living and breathing commotion
on canvas, as in that █████████ hall at ██████████; where the ████████
fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great ███████ of
France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the
successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
████████? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea
battle-pieces of Garnery.

The natural ████████ of the French for seizing the ███████████████ of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England's
experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
finished ████████ at all capable of conveying the real spirit of
the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale
███████████ seem entirely content with ██████████ the mechanical outline
of things, such as the vacant ███████ of the whale; which, so far as
picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to █████████
the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly ████████ Right
whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale,
and three or four delicate ██████████ of narwhales and porpoises, treats
us to a series of █████████ engravings of boat hooks, ████████ knives,
and grapnels; and with the microscopic █████████ of a ███████████
███████ to the ██████████ of a shivering world ██████-six ███-███████ of
magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no █████████████ to the excellent
voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it
was certainly an █████████ not to have procured for every crystal a
sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.

In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
French engravings worthy of note, by some one who ██████████ himself
"H. ██████." One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose, nevertheless ████████ mention on other accounts. It is a quiet
noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,
███████, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails
of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both
drooping together in the ██████████ air. The effect is very fine, when
considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under
one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is
quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the
very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the
vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a
████; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is
about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances
lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the
smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of ████████; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
with earnest of squalls and █████, seems to ███████ the activity of the
excited seamen.



CHAPTER ██. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.


On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
crippled beggar (or ██████, as the sailors say) holding a painted board
before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.
There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed
to contain the missing leg in all its original █████████) is being
crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years,
they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that
stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his █████████████ has
now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in
Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you
will find in the western █████████. But, though for ever mounted on
that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with
downcast eyes, stands ████████ █████████████ his own ██████████.

Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and
Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
whaling-scenes, ██████ by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth,
or ladies' █████ wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other
like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous little
█████████ contrivances they ███████████ █████ out of the rough material,
in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes
of ███████████-looking implements, specially intended for the
███████████████ business. But, in general, they toil with their
jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent ████ of the sailor,
they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner's
fancy.

Long █████ from Christendom and ████████████ inevitably ████████ a man
to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called ████████.
Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a
savage, owning no ██████████ but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready
at any moment to █████ against him.

Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient ████████
war-club or spear-paddle, in its full ████████████ and ███████████ of
carving, is as great a ██████ of human ████████████ as a Latin lexicon.
For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth, that
miraculous █████████ of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
████ steady years of steady application.

As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth, of
his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
quite as ███████████, but as close packed in its ████████ of design,
as the Greek savage, ████████'s ██████; and full of barbaric spirit
and ██████████████, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, ██████
█████.

Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the ███████████
of American whalers. Some of them are done with much ████████.

At some old gable-██████ country houses you will see brass whales hung
by the tail for ████████ to the road-side door. When the ██████ is
sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking
whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
███████ and purposes so ████████ with "HANDS OFF!" you cannot examine
them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

In bony, █████ regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic █████████ upon the
plain, you will often discover images as of the █████████ forms of the
Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a █████ day breaks against
them in a surf of green ██████.

Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
girdled by ███████████████ ███████; here and there from some lucky
point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the ████████ of
whales ███████ along the undulating ██████. But you must be a thorough
whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you wish
to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the exact
████████████ latitude and longitude of your first stand-point, else
so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise,
previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like the
██████ Islands, which still remain █████████, though once high-██████
████████ trod them and old ███████ ██████████ them.

Nor when ███████████ lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
great whales in the ██████ heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw ██████
locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
Leviathan round and round the Pole with the ███████████ of the bright
points that first defined him to me. And beneath the █████████ Antarctic
skies I have boarded the ████-█████, and joined the chase against the
starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of ██████ and the Flying
Fish.

With a frigate's anchors for my ██████-bitts and ██████ of harpoons for
spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
see whether the ██████ heavens with all their countless tents really lie
████████ beyond my mortal sight!



CHAPTER ██. Brit.


Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it █████████ round us, so that we
seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.

On the second day, ███████ of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws ██████████
swam through the brit, which, adhering to the ████████ fibres of that
wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner █████████
from the water that escaped at the lip.

As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and ██████████ advance
their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
monsters swam, making a strange, ██████, cutting sound; and leaving
behind them endless ██████ of blue upon the yellow sea.*


*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks" does
not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
being ████████ and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast ██████ of brit continually
floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.


But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked
more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the
great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such, taking them for bare, █████████ ██████████ of the soil; even
so, often, with him, who for the first time ███████ this species of the
leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their immense
magnitude ███████ it very hard really to believe that such █████ masses
of ██████████ can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort
of life that lives in a dog or a horse.

Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though
some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of
the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to ███████████, where, for
example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be said to bear comparative ███████ to him.

But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
seas have ever been regarded with emotions ███████████ ████████ and
█████████; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
so that ████████ sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one ███████████ western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific
of all mortal disasters have ████████████ and indiscriminately ████████
████ and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
though but a moment's consideration will teach, that however baby man
may ████ of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
the ██████████, ████████ frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which ████████████ belongs to it.

The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided;
two thirds of the fair world it yet ██████.

Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a ███████ upon one is not a
miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the ███████,
when under the feet of █████ and his company the live ground opened
and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.

But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
████████ his own guests; ███████ not the creatures which itself hath
███████. Like a savage ███████ that tossing in the ██████ ████████ her
own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks,
and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No
mercy, no power but its own ████████ it. Panting and snorting like a mad
battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean ████████ the
globe.

Consider the ██████████ of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
under water, ██████████ for the most part, and treacherously hidden
beneath the █████████ tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
██████████ and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
the universal ███████████ of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.

Consider all this; and then turn to this green, ██████, and most docile
earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
surrounds the ███████ land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but ███████████ by all the horrors of the
half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou █████
never return!


CHAPTER ██. Squid.


Slowly ██████ through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
way north-eastward towards the island of ████; a gentle air █████████
her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that ███████ breeze, as three mild palms on a
plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
alluring jet would be seen.

But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea, however ██████████ with any ████████ calm; when
the long █████████ sun-█████ on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them, █████████ some secrecy; when the █████████ waves whispered
together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange ███████ was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.

In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
higher, and █████████████ itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening
for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more █████,
and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
more, with a ████████-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
negro yelled out--"There! there again! there she breaches! right ahead!
The White Whale, the White Whale!"

Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in ████████-time the
████ rush to the ██████. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on
the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.

Whether the flitting ██████████ of the one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to ███████ the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
him; █████████ way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
orders for lowering.

The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with
oars suspended, we were awaiting its ████████████, lo! in the same
spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost ██████████ for
the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind.
A vast █████ mass, ████████ in length and breadth, of a glancing
cream-colour, lay floating on the water, ███████████ long arms radiating
from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of █████████, as
if blindly to clutch at any ███████ object within reach. No ███████████
face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either █████████ or
instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,
chance-like apparition of life.

As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to
have seen thee, thou white ghost!"

"What was it, Sir?" said Flask.

"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
returned to their ports to tell of it."

But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
the rest as silently following.

Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being
so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousness. So ██████ is it beheld, that though one and all of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale
his only food. For though other species of whales find their food above
water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti
whale ███████ his whole food in unknown █████ below the surface; and
only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that
food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will ████████ what
are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus
exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that
the monster to which these arms belonged ██████████ ██████ by them to
the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is
supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.

There seems some ground to imagine that the great ██████ of ██████
███████████ may ██████████ resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
which the Bishop █████████ it, as ███████████ rising and sinking, with
some other particulars he ████████, in all this the two correspond.
But much █████████ is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
███████ it.

By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
but only as the ████ of the tribe.



CHAPTER ██. The Line.


With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
I have here to speak of the ███████, sometimes horrible whale-line.

The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
████████ with tar, not ███████████ with it, as in the case of ordinary
ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more ███████ to
the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity
too much ███████ the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must
be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general
by no means ████ to the rope's ██████████ or strength, however much it
may give it ███████████ and █████.

Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
entirely ██████████ hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
so ███████ as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
I will add (since there is an ██████████ in all things), is much more
handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired ██████████
to behold.

The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in █████████. At first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each ███████ a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something
over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is ████████
coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so
as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of ███████ ██████ "sheaves," or
██████ of ██████████ ██████████████, without any hollow but the "heart,"
or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least
██████ or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost ██████████ is used
in ███████ the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will ███████ almost an
entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then
███████ it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act
of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and ██████.

In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this;
because these ████-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the
boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly
three feet in ████████ and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky
███████ for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for
the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up
a considerable ███████████ weight, but not very much of a concentrated
one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub,
the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great
wedding-████ to present to the whales.

Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end ███████████ in an
eye-splice or ████ coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub, and hanging over its edge completely ██████████ from everything.
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:
In order to ██████████ the █████████ to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
to ████████ to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a ███
of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the
first boat always ██████ at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the
lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the ██████████ of
the sea; and in that case no town-█████ would ever find her again.

Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again
carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon
the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it ████ against his wrist
in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at
the opposite gunwales, to the ██████ ██████ or grooves in the extreme
pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a
common █████, ████████ it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs
in a slight ███████ over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat
again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled
upon the box in the bows, it █████████ its way to the gunwale still a
little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp--the rope
which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that
connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry ██████████████ too ███████
to detail.

Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
twisting and ████████ around it in almost every direction. All the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous ███████████; so that to the timid
eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian ████████, with the deadliest
██████ ██████████ ██████████ their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen ███████████,
and while █████████ his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
█████████████ without a shudder that makes the very ██████ in his bones
to quiver in him like a shaken █████. Yet habit--strange thing! what
cannot habit accomplish?--█████ ███████, more merry █████, better █████,
and brighter █████████, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
hung in ███████'s ██████; and, like the six ████████ of ██████ before
King ██████, the six men █████████ the crew pull into the jaws of death,
with a ██████ around every neck, as you may say.

Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually
chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the
line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in
the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold █████████
of a steam-██████ in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
wheel, is ███████ you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the
heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a ██████, and
you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;
and only by a certain self-█████████ ████████ and ████████████████ of
volition and action, can you escape being made a ███████ of, and run
away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never ██████ you out.

Again: as the profound calm which only apparently ████████ and
██████████ of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder, and the ball, and the █████████; so the ████████ repose of the
line, as it silently ███████████ about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with ███████ round their
necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
that mortals ███████ the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
your evening fire with a █████, and not a harpoon, by your side.



CHAPTER ██. Stubb Kills a Whale.


If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
Queequeg it was quite a different object.

"When you see him 'quid," said the savage, ██████ his harpoon in the bow
of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him '████ whale."

The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly ██████ the spell of sleep
induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
which we then were ████████ is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
that is, it ███████ █████ glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
and other vivacious ████████ of more stirring waters, than those off the
Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.

It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
what seemed an enchanted air. No ██████████ could withstand it; in that
dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my
body; though my body still continued to sway as a ████████ will, long
after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.

Ere █████████████ altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last
all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing
that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman.
The waves, too, ██████ their indolent crests; and across the wide trance
of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.

Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like █████ my
hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, ██████ back, of an Ethiopian hue,
glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in
the ██████ of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his ███████
jet, the whale looked like a portly ███████ smoking his pipe of a warm
afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
█████████'s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
started into ███████████; and more than a score of voices from all parts
of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
the sparkling brine into the air.

"Clear away the boats! ████!" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the ██████.

The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
the boats were down, ████████████ turning, he swam away to the leeward,
but with such a steady ████████████, and making so few ripples as he
swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave
orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in
whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats,
we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the
noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the
monster perpendicularly ███████ his tail forty feet into the air, and
then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.

"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
Stubb's producing his match and ████████ his pipe, for now a respite was
granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
rose again, and being now in advance of the ██████'s boat, and much
nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honour
of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become
aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no
longer of use. ███████ were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And
still puffing at his pipe, Stubb ███████ on his crew to the assault.

Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,
he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed.*


*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists. Though
apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
him. So that with ease he ████████ it in the air, and invariably does
so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the
upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
formation of the lower part, that by obliquely █████████ his head, he
thereby may be said to █████████ himself from a bluff-bowed ████████
███████ into a ████████████ New York pilot-boat.


"Start her, start her, my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of
time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all," cried
Stubb, ███████████ out the smoke as he spoke. "Start her, now; give 'em
the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy--start
her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--█████████ is the word--easy,
easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
buried dead perpendicular out of their ██████, boys--that's all. Start
her!"

"███-███! ██-███!" ████████ the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
old war-█████ to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily ███████ forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
which the eager Indian gave.

But his wild ███████ were answered by others quite as wild. "███-hee!
Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining ████████ and █████████ on his seat,
like a pacing tiger in his ████.

"██-la! ███-███!" howled Queequeg, as if ████████ his lips over a
████████ of Grenadier's █████. And thus with oars and █████ the █████
cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb █████████ his place in the van, still
██████████ his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
his mouth. Like desperadoes they ██████ and they strained, till the
welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give it to him!" The
harpoon was hurled. "Stern all!" The oarsmen backed water; the same
moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.
It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two
additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
increased rapid █████████, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and ███████
with the steady █████ from his pipe. As the line passed round and
round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
████████████ passed through and through both of Stubb's hands, from
which the hand-██████, or squares of ███████ canvas sometimes worn at
these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy's
sharp two-█████ sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving
to wrest it out of your clutch.

"Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
here changed places--stem for stern--a ██████████ business truly in that
rocking commotion.


*Partly to show the █████████████████ of this act, it may here be
stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a ███ was used to dash the
running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden ██████, or
██████, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
convenient.


From the █████████ line extending the entire length of the upper part of
the boat, and from its now being more tight than a ██████████, you would
have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water, the other
the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once.
A continual cascade ██████ at the bows; a █████████ whirling ████ in
her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little
finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale
into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main ████████
to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of
Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring
down his centre of gravity. Whole █████████ and ████████ seemed passed
as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
his flight.

"Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately ████████
out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up for
another fling.

The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like ██████ down a
hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which ███████
and ███████ for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
upon this ███████ ████ in the sea, sent back its ██████████ into every
face, so that they all ██████ to each other like red men. And all
the while, jet after jet of white smoke was ███████████ shot from the
████████ of the whale, and ████████ puff after puff from the mouth of
the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked
lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and
again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again
sent it into the whale.

"Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the ██████ whale
relaxed in his wrath. "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat ranged along
the fish's flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned
his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
████████ and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the
innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from
his trance into that unspeakable thing called his "██████," the monster
████████ ████████ in his blood, ███████████ himself in impenetrable,
mad, boiling spray, so that the ██████████ craft, instantly dropping
astern, had much ado blindly to ████████ out from that █████████
twilight into the clear air of the day.

And now ███████ in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
surging from side to side; █████████████ ████████ and ███████████ his
spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, ████████ ████████████. At last, gush
after gush of ███████ red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!

"He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.

"Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
████████████ eyeing the vast corpse he had made.



CHAPTER ██. The Dart.


A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.

According to the ██████████ usage of the fishery, the whale-boat ██████
off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-████████ pulling the foremost
oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous
arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called
a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of
twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase,
the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the █████████;
indeed, he is expected to set an example of ██████████ activity to the
rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid
exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's
compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started--what
that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot ████
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this
straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once
the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and give it
to him!" He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his
centre half way, seize his harpoon from the ██████, and with what little
strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No
wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty
fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many
hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and ████████; no wonder that some
of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that
some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder
that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the
harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his
body how can you ██████ to find it there when most wanted!

Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
that is, when the whale starts to run, the ██████████ and harpooneer
likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and
the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
station in the bows of the boat.

Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish
and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to
last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing
whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious
to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
of speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more
than one nation has convinced me that in the vast ████████ of failures
in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the
whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has
caused them.

To insure the greatest ██████████ in the dart, the harpooneers of this
world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of
toil.



CHAPTER ██. The Crotch.


Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the █████. So, in
██████████ subjects, grow the chapters.

The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
It is a ███████ stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which
is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow,
for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the
harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end █████████ ████████ from the prow.
Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its ██████, who snatches it
up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from
the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons ████████ in the crotch,
respectively called the first and second irons.

But these two harpoons, each by its own ████, are both connected with
the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming
drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a
████████ of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the
instantaneous, violent, ██████████ running of the whale upon receiving
the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however
lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,
and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be
██████████████ tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the
most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water,
it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned
in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, █████████
practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the
saddest and most fatal casualties.

Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard, it ███████████ becomes a ████████, sharp-edged terror,
██████████ ██████████ about both boat and whale, ██████████ the lines,
or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
fairly captured and a corpse.

Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all ████████
one █████████ strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
qualities in him, as well as to the thousand ██████████ accidents of
such an audacious ██████████, eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied
with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one
be █████████████ darted without recovery. All these particulars are
██████████ narrated here, as they will not fail to █████████ several
most important, however intricate ████████, in scenes hereafter to be
painted.



CHAPTER ██. Stubb's Supper.


Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was
a calm; so, forming a ██████ of three boats, we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men
with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty ██████ and fingers,
slowly ██████ hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the
sea; and it seemed hardly to █████ at all, except at long intervals;
good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we
moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call
it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky
█████████ junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand ██████ we
towed heavily ██████ along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.

Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
dropping one of several more ████████ over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing
the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing
it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way
into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.

Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature
was dead, some vague ███████████████, or impatience, or despair, seemed
working in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that
Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were
brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand,
monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on
the Pequod's decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust
rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking █████, the vast
corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the
stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black
hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night,
which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale,
seemed yoked together like colossal ████████, ███████ one ████████ while
the other remains standing.*


*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater ███████ that part
is ██████████ ███████ than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
███████████ even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so
that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ███████████ ████████: a
small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and
a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By
██████ management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked
fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of ████████ with
its broad flukes or █████.


If moody Ahab was now all ██████████, at least so far as could be known
on deck, Stubb, his second mate, ███████ with ████████, betrayed an
unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, ███████
cause of all this ██████████ in Stubb, was soon made strangely ████████.
Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat █████████████ fond of the whale
as a █████████ thing to his ██████.

"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
me one from his small!"

Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy ██████
the current ████████ of the war (at least before █████████ the proceeds
of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale
designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.

About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb ███████ stood up to his spermaceti supper
at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a █████████. Nor was Stubb
the only █████████ on whale's flesh that night. ████████ their █████████
with his own ████████████, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming
round the dead leviathan, ██████████ ███████ on its ███████. The few
sleepers below in their █████ were often startled by the sharp ████████
of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers'
hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you
heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on
their backs as they ███████ out huge globular pieces of the whale of the
bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all
but miraculous. How at such an apparently ████████████ surface, they
████████ to █████ out such ███████████ mouthfuls, remains a part of the
universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale,
may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in ██████████████
for a █████.

Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
will be seen █████████ gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down
every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
butchers over the deck-table are thus ██████████ carving each other's
live meat with carving-knives all gilded and █████████, the sharks,
also, with their █████-██████ mouths, are █████████████ carving away
under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole
affair ██████ down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that
is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and
though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
crossing the Atlantic, systematically ████████ alongside, to be █████ in
case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently
buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down,
touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most
socially ██████████, and most ███████████ feast; yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers, and in gayer or more ██████ spirits, than around a dead sperm
whale, moored by night to a █████████ at sea. If you have never
seen that sight, then suspend your ████████ about the propriety of
devil-worship, and the ██████████ of ████████████ the devil.

But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his
own █████████ lips.

"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length, ████████
his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
with his lance; "cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!"

The old black, not in any very high ████ at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came █████████
along from his ██████, for, like many old ██████, there was something
the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like
his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and
limping along, █████████ his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy
fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered
along, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on
the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard; when, with both hands folded
before him, and resting on his two-██████ cane, he bowed his arched back
still further over, at the same time sideways █████████ his head, so as
to bring his best ear into play.

"Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather ███████ ██████ to his
mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather ████████? You've been
beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender. Don't I always say
that to be good, a whale-steak must be █████? There are those sharks
now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
██████ they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to 'em; tell 'em they are
welcome to help themselves ███████, and in ██████████, but they must
keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and
deliver my ███████. Here, take this lantern," snatching one from his
sideboard; "now then, go and preach to 'em!"

Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck
to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the
sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand
he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a
mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling
behind, overheard all that was said.

"Fellow-████████: I'██ ordered here to say ███ you must stop dat dam
noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam ███████' ██ de lips! █████ Stubb say
dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de █████████, but by ███! you
must stop dat dam racket!"

"Cook," here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden ████
on the shoulder,--"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you █████'t swear that way
when you're preaching. That's no way to ███████ sinners, cook!"

"Who dat? Den preach to him yourself," sullenly turning to go.

"No, cook; go on, go on."

"Well, den, ███████ fellow-critters:"--

"Right!" exclaimed Stubb, ███████████, "████ 'em to it; try that," and
Fleece continued.

"Do you is all sharks, and by █████ ████ █████████, yet I ███ to you,
fellow-critters, dat dat █████████████--'top dat dam ███████' ob de
tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin' and
█████' dare?"

"Cook," cried Stubb, █████████ him, "I won't have that swearing. Talk to
'em ███████████."

Once more the sermon proceeded.

"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't █████ ye so much for; dat
is natur, and can't be helped; but to ██████ dat wicked natur, dat is de
pint. You is sharks, ██████; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den
you be angel; for all angel is not'███ more dan de shark well ████████.
Now, look here, bred'███, just try █████ to be █████, a helping
█████████ from dat whale. Don't be ██████' de blubber out your
█████████'s ████, I say. Is not one shark dood right as █████ to dat
whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
belong to some one else. I know some o' you has █████ brig mout, ███████
dan █████; but den de brig █████ sometimes has de small bellies; so dat
de ████████ of de mout is not to ███████ ███, but to bit off de blubber
for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get into de ███████ to help
█████████."

"Well done, old Fleece!" cried Stubb, "that's Christianity; go on."

"No use goin' on; de dam ████████ will keep a ███████' and slappin' each
████, Massa Stubb; ███ don't hear one word; no use a-preaching to
such dam █'██████ as you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and dare
bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont hear you
den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and
can't hear noting at all, no more, for ████ and eber."

"Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."

Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
██████ voice, and cried--

"██████ fellow-critters! Kick up de ████████ row as ever you can; fill
your dam bellies 'till dey ████--and den die."

"Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; "stand
just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
attention."

"All '███████," said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
desired position.

"Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go
back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,
cook?"

"What dat do wid de '████," said the old black, ███████.

"Silence! How old are you, cook?"

"'Bout ninety, dey say," he ████████ muttered.

"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?" rapidly ███████ another
mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a ████████████ of the
question. "Where were you born, cook?"

"'Hind de hatchway, in █████-boat, goin' ████ de ███████."

"Born in a ferry-boat! That's queer, too. But I want to know what
country you were born in, cook!"

"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.

"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.
You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a
whale-steak yet."

"█████ my soul, if I cook █████ one," he growled, ███████, turning round
to depart.

"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit of
steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be?
Take it, I say"--holding the tongs towards him--"take it, and taste it."

Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; █████, berry joosy."

"Cook," said Stubb, ████████ himself once more; "do you belong to the
church?"

"Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.

"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where
you doubtless overheard a holy ██████ addressing his hearers as his
beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and
tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb. "Where
do you expect to go to, cook?"

"Go to bed berry soon," he ███████, half-turning as he spoke.

"Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It's an awful question. Now
what's your answer?"

"When ███ old █████ man ████," said the negro slowly, changing his whole
air and ████████, "he ███████ won't go nowhere; but some ███████ angel
will come and fetch him."

"Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they ███████ Elijah? And fetch
him where?"

"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
keeping it there very solemnly.

"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you
are dead? But don't you know the higher you climb, the ██████ it gets?
Main-top, eh?"

"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the █████.

"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where
your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don't
get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It's a
████████ business, but must be done, or else it's no go. But none of
us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye
hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other a'top of your heart,
when I'm giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?--that's
your ███████! Aloft! aloft!--that's it--now you have it. Hold it there
now, and pay attention."

"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
vainly wriggling his ████████ head, as if to get both ears in front at
one and the same time.

"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don't
you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my
private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so as not to
spoil it by █████████. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal
to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear? And now to-morrow,
cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get
the ████ of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the
flukes, have them ██████, cook. There, now ye may go."

But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.

"Cook, give me ███████ for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
D'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
go.--Avast heaving again! Whale-█████ for breakfast--don't forget."

"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, '█████ of him eat whale. I'm bressed if
he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself," muttered the old man,
limping away; with which sage ███████████ he went to his hammock.



CHAPTER ██. The Whale as a Dish.


That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it.

It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
Whale was ████████ a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
prices there. Also, that in Henry ██████'s time, a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for █████████ an admirable sauce to be
eaten with █████████ porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well
seasoned and ██████ might be taken for ██████-balls or ████ balls.
The old █████ of ███████████ were very fond of them. They had a great
porpoise grant from the crown.

The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
when you come to sit down before a meat-███ nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most ████████████ of men
like Stubb, nowadays ███████ of cooked whales; but the █████████ are not
so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
old ████████ of prime old train oil. ████████, one of their most famous
doctors, ██████████ ██████ of blubber for ███████, as being exceedingly
juicy and ██████████. And this ███████ me that certain ██████████, who
long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel--that
these men actually lived for several months on the ██████ ██████ of
whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among
the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called "████████"; which, indeed,
they greatly ████████, being brown and █████, and smelling something
like old Amsterdam ██████████' dough-nuts or ███-cooks, when fresh. They
have such an ███████ look that the most self-███████ stranger can hardly
keep his hands off.

But what further ███████████ the whale as a civilized dish, is his
exceeding ████████. He is the great █████ ox of the sea, too fat to be
██████████ good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as
the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
is; like the transparent, half-███████, white meat of a ████████ in the
third month of its ██████, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance, and then █████████ of it. In the long try
watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
a good supper have I thus made.

In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,
whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large ████████),
they are then mixed with █████, and cooked into a most ██████████ mess,
in flavor somewhat resembling ██████' head, which is quite a dish among
some ████████; and every one knows that some young █████ among the
epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to
have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a
████'s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon
██████████████. And that is the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent looking calf's head before him, is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of █████████████ at
him, with an "██ ██ Brute!" expression.

It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so ███████████
████████ that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with ██████████;
that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before
mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,
and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever
murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if
he had been put on his █████ by ████, he certainly would have been; and
he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market
of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live ██████ staring up at the
long rows of dead ██████████. Does not that sight take a tooth out of
the cannibal's jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will
be more tolerable for the █████ that salted down a lean missionary in
his ██████ against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
█████████ Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized
and enlightened ████████, who ███████ █████ to the ground and ████████
on their ███████ livers in thy ████-de-████-████.

But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that █████ beef, what is
that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
that fat █████? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did
the █████████ of the Society for the ███████████ of ███████ to ███████
████████ ██████ his █████████? It is only within the last month or two
that that society passed a resolution to █████████ nothing but steel
████.



CHAPTER ██. The Shark ████████.


When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a'lee; and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the ███████████ that,
until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for
an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all goes well.

But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will
not answer at all; because such ████████████ hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning.
In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times ████████████
██████████, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-██████,
a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
██████ them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
present case with the Pequod's sharks; though, to be sure, any man
████████████ to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
those sharks the ███████ in it.

Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman
came on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
immediately ██████████ the cutting ██████ over the side, and lowering
three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep
into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the █████
confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the ████████ could not
always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe. They █████████ ███████, not only at each
other's ███████████████, but like ████████ bows, bent round, and bit
their own; till those ████████ seemed swallowed over and over again by
the same mouth, to be ██████████ ██████ by the gaping wound. Nor was
this all. It was ██████ to meddle with the ███████ and ghosts of these
creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried
to shut down the dead ███ of his murderous jaw.


*The whaling-█████ used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general shape,
███████████ to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably ████████ than
the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
being used is occasionally █████, just like a razor. In its socket, a
stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.


"Queequeg no care what god made him shark," said the savage, agonizingly
lifting his hand up and down; "██████ Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de
god ███ made shark must be one dam █████."



CHAPTER ██. Cutting In.


It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex ███████
██████████ of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
turned into what seemed a ███████; every sailor a ███████. You would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.

In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
things comprising a ███████ of blocks generally painted green, and which
no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up
to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest
point anywhere above a ship's deck. The end of the ██████-like rope
winding through these intricacies, was then █████████ to the windlass,
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to
this block the great blubber hook, ████████ some one hundred pounds, was
attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,
the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the
body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two
side-fins. This done, a broad, ████████████ line is cut round the hole,
the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
chorus, now commence heaving in one █████ crowd at the windlass. When
instantly, the entire ship ███████ over on her side; every bolt in
her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she
trembles, ███████, and ████ her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More
and more she █████ over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last,
a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great █████ the ship rolls
upwards and backwards from the whale, and the ██████████ tackle rises
into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the
first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
as the ████ does an ██████, so is it stripped off from the body
precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by ███████████ it. For the
strain ██████████ kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip
█████████ peels off along the line called the "█████," simultaneously
cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as
it is thus ██████ off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the
time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end ██████ the
main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment
or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass █████ to and fro as if let
down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to █████
it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong
overboard.

One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he ███████████ ██████
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this
hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked
so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what
follows. Whereupon, this accomplished █████████, warning all hands to
stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few
sidelong, desperate, lunging ████████, ██████ it completely in twain;
so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip,
called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.
The ███████ forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
███████ and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly
slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
right beneath, into an ███████████ parlor called the blubber-room. Into
this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents.
And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering
simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing,
the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates ████████, the ship
straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of █████████ the
general ████████.



CHAPTER ██. The Blanket.


I have given no small attention to that not ███████ subject, the skin of
the whale. I have had █████████████ about it with experienced whalemen
afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains
█████████; but it is only an opinion.

The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you
know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the ███████████
of firm, close-███████ beef, but ███████, more elastic and compact, and
██████ from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.

Now, however ████████████ it may at first seem to talk of any creature's
skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point
of fact these are no █████████ against such a presumption; because you
cannot raise any other dense ██████████ layer from the whale's body but
that same blubber; and the █████████ enveloping layer of any animal, if
██████████ dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the ████████
dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely
thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest ██████
of █████████, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is,
previous to being dried, when it not only █████████ and ████████, but
becomes rather hard and ███████. I have several such dried bits, which
I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;
and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself
with fancying it ███████ a ██████████ influence. At any rate, it is
pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may
say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin,
isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the
whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as
the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say,
that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is ███████ and more tender
than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.

Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or
rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three ███████,
and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had
of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere
██████████ yields such a lake of ██████ as that. Reckoning ten barrels
to the ███, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters
of the stuff of the whale's skin.

In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
marks do not seem to be █████████ upon the isinglass substance above
mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved
upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
█████████ eye, those ██████ marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
afford the ground for far other delineations. These are ██████████████;
that is, if you call those mysterious ███████ on the walls of pyramids
hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
connexion. By my █████████ memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm
Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old
Indian ██████████ █████████ on the famous ████████████ █████████ on
the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the
mystic-marked whale remains ██████████████. This allusion to the Indian
rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other █████████ which
the ████████ of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the
back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude █████████,
altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New
England rocks on the sea-coast, which ███████ ████████ to bear the marks
of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I should say,
that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this
particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are
probably made by ███████ contact with other whales; for I have most
████████ them in the large, full-grown █████ of the species.

A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whale. It has already been said, that it is ██████ from him in long
pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
happy and significant. For the whale is indeed █████ up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian ██████
█████ over his head, and ████████ his extremity. It is by reason of this
cosy ██████████ of his body, that the whale is ███████ to keep himself
comfortable in all ████████, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the
North, if ██████████ with his cosy ███████? True, other fish are
found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it
observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies
are █████████████; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of
an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would ████ before an inn fire;
whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. ██████ his blood,
and he dies. How wonderful is it then--except after ███████████--that
this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it
is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed
to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall
overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly
frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued
in █████. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by
experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is ██████ than that of a
██████ negro in summer.

It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
virtue of interior ████████████. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in
this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood
fluid at the Pole. Like the great ████ of St. Peter's, and like the
great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a ███████████ of thine own.

But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
how few are █████ like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few vast as the
whale!



CHAPTER ██. The Funeral.


Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!

The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
████████ whale ███████ like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
████████ by the █████████ sharks, and the air above vexed with █████████
flights of screaming fowls, whose █████ are like so many insulting
████████ in the whale. The vast white ████████ phantom floats further
and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem
square █████ of sharks and █████ roods of fowls, augment the murderous
din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous
sight is seen. Beneath the █████████ and mild azure sky, upon the fair
face of the pleasant sea, ██████ by the ██████ breezes, that great mass
of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite ████████████.

There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
pious ████████, the air-sharks all █████████████ in black or ████████.
In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ████, if
████████████ he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they
most ███████ do ██████. Oh, horrible ██████████ of earth! from which not
the mightiest whale is free.

Nor is this the end. ██████████ as the body is, a vengeful ghost
████████ and hovers over it to █████. ██████ by some timid man-of-war or
blundering discovery-vessel from ████, when the distance █████████ the
swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
whale's █████████ corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS: BEWARE! And for years
afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
sheep leap over a ██████, because their leader originally leaped there
when a stick was held. There's your law of ██████████; there's your
███████ of traditions; there's the story of your obstinate ████████ of
old beliefs never ████████ on the earth, and now not even hovering in
the air! There's █████████!

Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror
to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
world.

Are you a ████████ in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than
the Cock-████ one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in
them.



CHAPTER ██. The ██████.


It should not have been omitted that previous to completely █████████
the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the █████████ of the
Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.

Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the
surgeon must ███████ from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
███████████, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
in mind, too, that under these ████████ circumstances he has to cut many
feet deep in the flesh; and in that █████████████ manner, without so
much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting ████ thus
made, he must █████████ steer clear of all adjacent, ███████████ parts,
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
into the skull. Do you not ██████, then, at Stubb's boast, that he
demanded but ten minutes to ██████ a sperm whale?

When first ███████, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale
it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full
grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's head embraces
nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a
burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as
vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch ████ in jewellers' scales.

The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea, so that
it might yet in great part be ██████ up by its native element. And there
with the strained craft ███████ leaning over to it, by reason of the
enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the giant
██████████'s from the girdle of ██████.

When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
█████, was more and more █████████ its noiseless measureless leaves upon
the sea.

A short space elapsed, and up into this █████████████ came Ahab alone
from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he
took Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's
████████████--and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
mass, placed its other end ██████-wise under one arm, and so stood
leaning over with eyes ███████████ fixed on this head.

It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert. "Speak, thou vast
and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ███████████ with a
beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with ██████; speak, mighty head,
and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast
dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has
moved amid this world's foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies
rust, and ██████ hopes and anchors ███; where in her murderous hold this
frigate earth is █████████ with bones of millions of the drowned; there,
in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast
been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side,
where █████████ mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou
saw'st the locked ██████ when leaping from their flaming ship; heart
to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when
heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed
by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on
unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
would have borne a righteous ███████ to outstretched, ███████ arms. O
head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of
Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"

"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.

"Aye? Well, now, that's ████████," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.
"That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
man.--Where away?"

"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to
us!

"Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,
and to my ██████████████ bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!
how far beyond all utterance are your linked █████████! not the smallest
████ stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind."



CHAPTER ██. The ████████'s Story.


Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came ██████ than
the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.

By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads
proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting
by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could
not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would
be made.

Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of
the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which ███████
being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
considerable distances and with no small ████████.

The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting
her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring
her yards, she bore down, ranged █████ under the Pequod's lee, and
lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being
rigged by Starbuck's order to ███████████ the visiting captain, the
stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that
the Jeroboam had a malignant ████████ on board, and that ██████, her
captain, was fearful of █████████ the Pequod's company. For, though
himself and boat's crew remained █████████, and though his ship was half
a rifle-shot off, and an █████████████ sea and air rolling and flowing
between; yet ███████████████ adhering to the timid ██████████ of the
land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the
Pequod.

But this did by no means prevent all ██████████████. Preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam's
boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew
very fresh), with her main-███████ aback; though, indeed, at times by
the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some
way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper ████████
again. Subject to this, and other the like █████████████ now and then, a
conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not
without still another ████████████ of a very different sort.

Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual ████████████
make up all ██████████. He was a small, short, ████████ man, sprinkled
all over his face with ████████, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A
long-skirted, ██████████████-cut coat of a faded ██████ tinge enveloped
him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A
deep, settled, ███████ delirium was in his eyes.

So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
exclaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the long-██████ ██████████ the
Town-Ho's company told us of!" Stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account
and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
Jeroboam. His story was this:

He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of █████████
███████, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times █████████ from heaven by the way of a
trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing █████████,
was supposed to be charged with ████████. A strange, █████████ whim
having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with
that cunning peculiar to █████████, he assumed a steady, common-sense
exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the
Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon
the ship's getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a
███████. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
the captain to jump overboard. He published his █████████, whereby
he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
█████-general of all ████████. The unflinching earnestness with which he
declared these things;--the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited
imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united
to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant
crew, with an atmosphere of ██████████. Moreover, they were afraid of
him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,
especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous
captain would fain have been rid of him; but ████████ that that
individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the
archangel forthwith opened all his █████ and █████--████████ the ship
and all hands to █████████████ perdition, in case this intention was
carried out. So strongly did he work upon his █████████ among the crew,
that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel
was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore
forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any
way ██████████, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that
Gabriel had the complete ███████ of the ship. The consequence of all
this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand
than ever; declaring that the ██████, as he called it, was at his sole
command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.
The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them ██████ before
him; in obedience to his ████████████, sometimes █████████ him personal
homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however
wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of ████████ half so striking
in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as
his measureless power of █████████ and ███████████ so many others. But
it is time to return to the Pequod.

"I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."

But now Gabriel started to his feet.

"Think, think of the ██████, yellow and ███████! Beware of the horrible
plague!"

"Gabriel! Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either--" But
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
drowned all speech.

"Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat ███████
back.

"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible
tail!"

"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--" But again the boat tore ahead as if
dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession
of ███████ waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional ████████
of the seas were ████████, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm
whale's head ██████ about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing
it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to
warrant.

When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without ████████ interruptions from
Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
leagued with him.

It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby
Dick, and the havoc he had made. ████████ sucking in this intelligence,
Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White
Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his █████████ insanity,
pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the ██████ God
██████████; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two
afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the
chief mate, ██████ with ██████ to encounter him; and the captain himself
being not █████████ to let him have the ███████████, ███████ all
the archangel's █████████████ and ████████████, Macey succeeded in
██████████ five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after
much weary pulling, and many perilous, ████████████ ██████, he at last
succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to
the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and
███████ forth ██████████ of speedy doom to the ████████████ assailants
of his ████████. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his
boat's bow, and with all the ████████ energy of his tribe was ███████
his wild exclamations upon the whale, and ████████ to get a fair chance
for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious
life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his
descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a
chip of the boat was ██████, nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the
mate for ever sank.

It is well to ████████████ here, that of the fatal accidents in the
Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus ███████████;
oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
headsman stands, is torn from its place and ███████████ the body. But
strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
discernible; the man being stark dead.

The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried
from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the vial!" Gabriel
called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the
whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;
because his credulous disciples believed that he had ████████████
fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any
one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
wide ██████ allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.

Mayhew having concluded his █████████, Ahab put such questions to
him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
Ahab answered--"Aye." Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started
to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the ██████████--dead, and down
there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"

Ahab ████████ turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have
just █████████ me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag."

Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
whose ████████ to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends
upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus,
most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after
attaining an age of two or three years or more.

Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was ██████ tumbled,
damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence
of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death
himself might well have been the post-boy.

"Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab. "Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but
a dim ██████;--what's this?" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
██████ the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
its coming any closer to the ship.

Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. ███--yes, Mr.
Harry--(a woman's █████ hand,--the man's wife, I'll █████)--Aye--Mr.
Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"

"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but let
me have it."

"Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going that
way."

"Curses ████████ thee!" yelled Ahab. "Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
receive it"; and taking the fatal ███████ from Starbuck's hands, he
caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat.
But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat
drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by magic, the
letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it
in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,
sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then
Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in
that manner the ████████ boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.

As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affair.



CHAPTER ██. The Monkey-Rope.


In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there
is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are
wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no ███████
in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done
everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description
of the scene. We must now ███████ our way a little. It was mentioned
that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook
was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend
Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the
monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many
cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the
whale till the whole ████████ or stripping operation is concluded. The
whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely █████████, excepting the
immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the
level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the
whale and half in the water, as the vast mass ████████ like a tread-████
beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the
Highland ███████--a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least,
he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to
observe him, as will presently be seen.

Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to
attend upon him while taking that hard-████████ ████████ upon the dead
whale's back. You have seen Italian █████-boys holding a dancing-ape by
a long cord. Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg
down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery
a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waist.

It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were
wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage
and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag
me down in his wake. So, then, an █████████ ███████ ████████ united us.
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get
rid of the dangerous ███████████ which the hempen ████ entailed.

So strongly and ██████████████ did I ████████ of my █████████ then, that
while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive
that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of
two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's
mistake or ██████████ might plunge innocent me into █████████ disaster
and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of ███████████ in
Providence; for its even-handed ██████ never could have so █████ an
injustice. And yet still further pondering--while I ██████ him now
and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to ███
him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine
was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most
cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a █████████
of other mortals. If your ██████ breaks, you snap; if your ██████████ by
mistake █████ you poison in your █████, you die. True, you may say
that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the
█████████████ other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's
monkey-rope █████████ as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came
very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I
would, I only had the management of one end of it.*


*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
that the monkey and his ██████ were ever tied together. This ███████████
upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb,
in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible
█████████ for the ████████████ and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.


I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only ███████ jeopardy
he was exposed to. ██████████ by the massacre made upon them during the
night, the sharks now ███████ and more ██████ allured by the before pent
blood which began to flow from the ███████--the █████ creatures ███████
round it like bees in a ███████.

And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
███████████████ ███████████ shark will seldom touch a man.

Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
████████ finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.
Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked
the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed
a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still another
protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego
and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
whale-spades, █████████ they ███████████ as many sharks as they could
reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very █████████████ and
benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best █████████, I admit; but
in their hasty ████ to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both
he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-███████ water,
those ██████████ spades of theirs would come nearer ██████████ a leg
than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there
with that great iron hook--poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his
Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.

Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
and then ███████ off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters
it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you ████ in, is Life; those
sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.

But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as
with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs
up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over
the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, ███████████
glance hands him--what? Some hot ██████? No! hands him, ye gods! hands
him a cup of tepid ginger and water!

"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?" ████████████ asked Stubb, coming near.
"Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet ████████ cup. Then
standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you have
the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger?
Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to ██████ a fire
in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!--what the devil is ginger?
Sea-coal? ████████?--███████ ███████?--██████?--gunpowder?--what the
devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg
here."

"There is some ████████ Temperance Society movement about this
business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
come from forward. "Will you look at that ████████, sir; smell of it,
if you please." Then watching the mate's countenance, he added, "The
steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that ███████ and █████
to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an
apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of ███████ by
which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"

"I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."

"Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to ████ a
harpooneer; none of your apothecary's ████████ here; you want to poison
us, do ye? You have got out ██████████ on our lives and want to murder
us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"

"It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought the
ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but
only this ginger-███--so she called it."

"Ginger-jub! you ████████ rascal! take that! and run along with ye
to the ███████, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
Starbuck. It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a
whale."

"Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but--"

"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
that sort; and this fellow's a ██████. What were you about saying, sir?"

"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."

When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort
of tea-█████ in the other. The first █████████ strong spirits, and was
handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was
freely given to the waves.



CHAPTER ██. Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk
Over Him.


It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side. But we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.
For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the
head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional ███████ of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not ████████████ to
cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale
had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if
opportunity offered.

Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at
first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom, within three ████ of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
view, as if ██████ under the keel. "Cut, cut!" was the cry from the
ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side. But having plenty
of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was
intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the █████████ line
in one direction, and still █████ their oars in another, the ██████████
strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance
they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when
instantly, a swift ██████ was felt running like lightning along the
keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose
to view under her bows, snapping and █████████; and so flinging off its
█████████, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water,
while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were
free to fly. But the ██████ whale ██████ his speed, and blindly ████████
his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him, so that they █████████ a complete ███████.

Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
████████ him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
██████████ of sharks that had before ████ round the Sperm Whale's body,
rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, █████████ drinking at every
new gash, as the eager ██████████ did at the new bursting █████████ that
poured from the smitten rock.

At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and █████, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
conversation ensued between them.

"I wonder what the old man wants with this ████ of foul ████," said
Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathan.

"Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's bow,
"did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale's
head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale's
on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never
afterwards ███████?"

"Why not?

"I don't know, but I heard that ███████ ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
and he seems to know all about ships' charms. But I sometimes think
he'll charm the ship to no good at last. I don't half like that chap,
Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into
a █████'s head, Stubb?"

"Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of
both hands--"Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
████████. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
stowed away on board ship? He's the devil, I say. The reason why you
don't see his tail, is because he █████ it up out of sight; he carries
it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of
it, he's always wanting █████ to stuff into the toes of his boots."

"He sleeps in his boots, don't he? He hasn't got any hammock; but I've
seen him lay of nights in a ████ of rigging."

"No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
see, in the eye of the rigging."

"What's the old man have so much to do with him for?"

"Striking up a ████ or a ███████, I suppose."

"Bargain?--about what?"

"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he'll
surrender Moby Dick."

"Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?"

"I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flag-ship once, █████████ his tail about devilish easy and
█████████████, and inquiring if the old ████████ was at home. Well, he
was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.' 'What for?' says the old
governor. 'What business is that of yours,' says the devil, getting
mad,--'I want to use him.' 'Take him,' says the governor--and by the
Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the Asiatic cholera before
he got through with him, I'll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
sharp--ain't you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let's get
the whale alongside."

"I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."

"Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded ████████? Did
ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?"

"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"

"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn't the devil live
for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see
any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
█████-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he can
crawl into a ████████? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"

"How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"

"Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's
the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold, and string
along in a row with that mast, for ██████, do you see; well, that
wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age. Nor all the coopers in creation
couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."

"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going
to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard--tell me
that?

"Give him a good ducking, anyhow."

"But he'd crawl back."

"Duck him again; and keep ducking him."

"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes, and
drown you--what then?"

"I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black eyes
that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin again for
a long while, let alone down in the █████ there, where he lives, and
hereabouts on the upper decks where he ██████ so much. Damn the devil,
Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil? Who's afraid of
him, except the old governor who ██████'t catch him and put him in
double-███████, as he deserves, but ████ him go about ██████████
people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
█████████, he'd roast for him? There's a governor!"

"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to ██████ Captain Ahab?"

"Do I suppose it? You'll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious
going on, I'll just take him by the ████ of his neck, and say--Look
here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord
I'll make a ████ into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short
off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds
himself ██████ in that queer fashion, he'll █████ off without the poor
satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs."

"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"

"Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"

"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?"

"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."

The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where
fluke chains and other ███████████ were already prepared for securing
him.

"Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right
whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's."

In good time, Flask's saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the ████████████ of
both heads, she ████████ her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in █████'s head, you go
over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in ████'s and you come
back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
████████ boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
and then you will float light and right.

In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off
whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is
called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case,
had been done. The ████████ of both whales had dropped astern; and
the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
█████████████ ████████.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the ██████ occupied his shadow;
while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only to
blend with, and ████████ Ahab's. As the crew toiled on, ██████████
speculations were ███████ among them, concerning all these passing
things.



CHAPTER ██. The Sperm Whale's Head--██████████ View.


Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
join them, and lay together our own.

Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
Whale are by far the most ██████████. They are the only whales regularly
hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two ████████ of all
the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between
them is mainly ██████████ in their heads; and as a head of each is this
moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one
to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:--where, I should like
to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology
than here?

In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these
heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain
████████████ ████████ in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly
█████. There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold
it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point
of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is
heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,
giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what
the fishermen technically call a "grey-headed whale."

Let us now note what is least ██████████ in these heads--namely, the two
most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of
the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you
narrowly search, you will at last see a ████████ eye, which you would
fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all ██████████ is it to the
magnitude of the head.

Now, from this peculiar ███████ position of the whale's eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale's
eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for
yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways ██████ objects
through your ears. You would find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you, with ██████ uplifted in broad day, you would not
be able to see him, any more than if he were ████████ upon you from
behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
same time, also, two ██████ (side fronts): for what is it that makes the
front of a man--what, indeed, but his eyes?

Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
are so planted as █████████████ to blend their visual power, so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
the whale's eyes, ███████████ divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in ███████; this, of course, must wholly separate the
impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,
must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
███████████ to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world
from a sentry-box with two joined ██████ for his window. But with the
whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct
windows, but sadly █████████ the view. This peculiarity of the whale's
eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be
remembered by the ██████ in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most ████████ question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
is ███████████; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience
will teach him, that though he can take in an ████████████████ sweep of
things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,
and completely, to examine any two things--however large or however
small--at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side
by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two
objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it, the other will be utterly ████████ from your ████████████
consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,
in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same
moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one
side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the ██████████████ of two distinct ████████
in ██████. Nor, strictly ████████████, is there any ███████████ in this
comparison.

It may be but an ████ whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
extraordinary ████████████ of movement displayed by some whales when
█████ by three or four boats; the timidity and █████████ to queer
███████, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless ██████████ of volition, in which their
divided and █████████████ opposite powers of vision must involve them.

But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
for hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external ████
whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
██████████ minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and ██████ covered
over with a ████████, so as to be quite █████████████ from without.

Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which
is smaller than a ████'s? But if his eyes were broad as the ████ of
████████'s great telescope; and his ears █████████ as the ███████ of
██████████; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
hearing? Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge" your mind?
█████████ it.

Let us now with whatever ██████ and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
might descend into the great ████████ ███████ Cave of his stomach. But
let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
a really beautiful and ██████-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
█████, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
bridal ██████.

But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense █████-box, with the █████ at one
end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific ██████████; and such,
alas! it ██████ to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
ship's jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only ██████████; out of
sorts, perhaps; █████████████; and so ██████, that the hinges of his
jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ████████ sort of plight, a
████████ to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, █████████ lock-jaws upon
him.

In most cases this lower jaw--being easily ████████ by a practised
artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to ██████-█████.

With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the other
work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished ████████,
are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances
the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to █████████, and a tackle being
rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
██████ of old ████ out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two
teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but █████████; nor filled
after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards ████ into slabs, and
piled away like ██████ for building houses.



CHAPTER ██. The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale's
head.

As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a
Roman war-███████ (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather inelegant
resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed ████. Two hundred years ago an
old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a █████████'s last. And
in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the ███████ tale, with
the swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her
progeny.

But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
look at these two F-shaped ██████████, you would take the whole head
for an enormous ████-████, and these █████████, the █████████ in its
sounding-board. Then, again, if you ███ your eye upon this strange,
███████, ████-like ████████████ on the top of the mass--this green,
barnacled thing, which the ████████████ call the "crown," and the
Southern fishers the "██████" of the Right Whale; ██████ your eyes
solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
with a bird's nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live
crabs that ██████ here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
technical term "crown" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
████████ king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very
sulky looking fellow to grace a ██████. Look at that hanging lower lip!
what a huge ████ and ████ is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's
███████████, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout
that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.

A great pity, now, that this ███████████ whale should be hare-lipped.
The ███████ is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the ████████ coast, when earthquakes
caused the beach to ████. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold,
we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should
take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the
road that Jonah went? The ████ is about twelve feet high, and runs to a
pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while
these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half
vertical, ████████-shaped █████ of whalebone, say three hundred on a
side, which █████████ from the upper part of the head or crown
bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been █████████
mentioned. The edges of these bones are ███████ with hairy fibres,
through which the Right Whale ███████ the water, and in whose
intricacies he ███████ the small fish, when ███████████ he goes through
the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they
stand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, ██████,
hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen █████████ the creature's age,
as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty of this
█████████ is far from ████████████, yet it has the █████ of ██████████
probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater
age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable.

In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
"whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "████' ████████"; a
third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
"There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
upper ████, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth."


*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of ███████, or
rather a █████████, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these
█████ impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.


As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"
"blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
other ██████████ contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
long been on the decline. It was in Queen ████'s time that the bone was
in its glory, the ███████████ being then all the fashion. And as those
ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
you may say; even so, in a ██████, with the like ███████████████, do we
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
tent spread over the same bone.

But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
██████████ of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think
you were inside of the great ███████ organ, and gazing upon its
thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a ███ of the ███████
██████--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
should say it was a six-████████; that is, it will yield you about that
amount of oil.

Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no great
well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender ████████ of a
lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any
of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a
tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm
Whale only one.

Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
not be very long in following.

Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there? It is the same
he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem
now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
█████████, born of a ███████████ indifference as to death. But mark the
other head's expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident
against the vessel's side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not
this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a █████; the Sperm
Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up ███████ in his latter years.



CHAPTER ██. The Battering-Ram.


Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have
you, as a sensible ████████████, simply--particularly remark its front
aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you ███████████
it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some █████████████,
intelligent ████████ of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged
there. Here is a vital point; for you must either ██████████████ settle
this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be
found in all recorded history.

You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water; you observe that the lower part of that front ██████ considerably
backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely
under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth
were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has
no external nose; and that what nose he has--his spout hole--is on the
top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.
Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm
Whale's head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender
██████████ of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider
that only in the extreme, lower, backward ███████ part of the front of
the head, is there the slightest ███████ of bone; and not till you
get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full ███████
███████████. So that this whole enormous ████████ mass is as one wad.
Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its ████████ partly ████████
the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of
the substance which so ███████████ invests all that apparent effeminacy.
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the
body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head;
but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so
thick, is of a boneless █████████, ███████████ by any man who has not
handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the ████████ lance darted by
the strongest human arm, ██████████ rebounds from it. It is as though
the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs. I do not
think that any sensation lurks in it.

Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded ████████
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold
there a large, round wad of tow and ████, enveloped in the thickest
and ████████ of ox-hide. That ███████ and uninjured takes the jam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
itself this sufficiently ███████████ the obvious fact I drive at. But
supplementary to this, it has ██████████████ occurred to me, that
as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming ███████ in them,
capable, at will, of ██████████ or ███████████; and as the Sperm Whale,
as far as I know, has no such █████████ in him; considering, too,
the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now █████████ his head
altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out
of the water; considering the ████████████ ██████████ of its envelope;
considering the ██████ interior of his head; it has hypothetically
occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-██████ ██████████ there
may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with
the outer air, so as to be ███████████ to atmospheric distension and
contraction. If this be so, fancy the ████████████████ of that might, to
which the most ██████████ and ███████████ of all elements contributes.

Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, ███████████
wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
is--by the cord; and all ████████ to one volition, as the smallest
insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
████████████ and ██████████████ of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable
████████ █████; I trust you will have █████████ all ignorant
incredulity, and be ready to █████ by this; that though the Sperm Whale
stove a passage through the ███████ of ██████, and mixed the Atlantic
with the Pacific, you would not ███████ one hair of your eye-brow. For
unless you own the whale, you are but a ██████████ and ██████████████
in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for ██████████ giants only to
encounter; how small the chances for the ███████████ then? What befell
the ████████ youth lifting the dread ███████'s veil at ████?



CHAPTER ██. The Great ███████████ ███.


Now comes the ██████ of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
upon.

Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two ██████,* whereof the lower
is the bony structure, forming the ███████ and jaws, and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
forehead horizontally █████████ this upper █████, and then you have two
almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
wall of a thick █████████ substance.


*Quoin is not a █████████ term. It belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
steep ███████████ of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
sides.


The lower ██████████ part, called the junk, is one immense █████████
of oil, formed by the crossing and ██████████, into ten thousand
███████████ cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great
Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is
██████████ carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms
innumerable strange ███████ for the emblematical █████████ of his
wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
with the most excellent of the █████ of the ███████ valleys, so the tun
of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;
namely, the highly-██████ spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, ██████,
and ███████████ state. Nor is this precious substance found █████████
in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly
fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to
concrete; sending forth beautiful ███████████ shoots, as when the
first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale's
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, █████, and
████████ away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
of securing what you can.

I know not with what fine and ██████ material the Heidelburgh Tun
was ██████ within, but in superlative richness that ███████ could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the
██████ of a fine ███████, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale's
case.

It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since--as
has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third of the whole
length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for
a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's
side.

As in ████████████ the whale, the ████████'s instrument is brought close
to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
████████; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
████████ stroke should ██████ the █████████ and █████████ let out its
invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by
the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side,
make quite a ██████████ of ropes in that quarter.

Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and--in
this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is ██████.



CHAPTER ██. ███████ and Buckets.


Nimble as a ███, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
posture, runs straight out upon the ███████████ mainyard-arm, to the
part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
██████████ through a single-███████ block. Securing this block, so that
it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
lands on the summit of the head. There--still high elevated above the
rest of the company, to whom he ███████████ cries--he seems some Turkish
███████ calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently ████████
for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business
he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other
end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three
█████ hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian,
to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this
pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward ██████ the bucket into the Tun,
till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the
whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a █████-maid's ████
of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the full-freighted
vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large
tub. Then ██████████ aloft, it again goes through the same round until
the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to
ram his long pole ██████ and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun,
until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.

Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a
queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,
was so ████████ and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed
hold on the great ██████ tackles suspending the head; or whether the
place where he stood was so treacherous and ████; or whether the Evil
One himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular
reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden,
as the █████████ or ninetieth bucket came █████████ up--my God! poor
Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with
a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!

"Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
came to his ██████. "Swing the bucket this way!" and putting one foot
into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
itself, the ████████ ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime,
there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those █████████ the perilous
depth to which he had sunk.

At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles--a
sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with
a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
motions of the head.

"Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.

"In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ███████ home a █████████
there?--Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
top of his head? Avast, will ye!"

"Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a
██████.

Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now over the
sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a thick mist of
spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the █████████ tackles, while poor,
buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea!
But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away, when a naked figure
with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud ██████ announced that my
brave Queequeg had dived to the ██████. One packed rush was made to the
side, and every eye counted every ██████, as moment followed moment, and
no sign of either the ██████ or the diver could be seen. Some hands now
jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.

"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave.

"Both! both!--it is both!"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the
waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.

Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after
the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
side ██████ near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He ███████, that upon first
thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had
thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
the good old way--head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
doing as well as could be expected.

And thus, through the courage and great skill in ██████████ of Queequeg,
the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully
accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently
hopeless ███████████; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
█████████ should be ██████ in the same course with ███████ and ██████,
riding and rowing.

I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either
seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an accident
which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the
Indian's, considering the exceeding ████████████ of the ████ of the
Sperm Whale's well.

But, peradventure, it may be ███████████ urged, how is this? We thought
the ███████, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the ████████ and
most █████ part about him; and yet thou ██████ it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been
nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense
tendinous wall of the well--a double welded, hammered substance, as I
have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which
█████ in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this
substance was in the present instance materially ████████████ by the
other parts of the head remaining ██████████ from it, so that it sank
very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance
for performing his █████ obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it
was a running delivery, so it was.

Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; █████████ in the very ███████ and █████████ of fragrant
spermaceti; ████████, ███████, and ██████ in the secret inner chamber
and ███████ █████████ of the whale. Only one ███████ end can readily be
recalled--the █████████ death of an Ohio █████-hunter, who seeking honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.
How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into █████'s honey head, and
sweetly perished there?



CHAPTER ██. The Prairie.


To ████ the lines of his face, or feel the █████ on the head of this
Leviathan; this is a thing which no █████████████ or ████████████ has as
yet ██████████. Such an enterprise would seem almost as ███████ as for
███████ to have ███████████ the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,
or for ████ to have mounted a ladder and ███████████ the Dome of the
████████. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats
of the various faces of men, but also attentively ███████ the faces
of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and ██████ in detail upon the
█████████████ of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and
his ████████ █████████ failed to throw out some hints touching the
█████████████ characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these
two semi-████████ to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things;
I ███████ what I can.

████████████████ regarded, the Sperm Whale is an █████████ creature.
He has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most ████████ and
finally controls their ████████ expression; hence it would seem that its
entire absence, as an external █████████, must very largely affect
the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape █████████, a █████,
██████, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
keeping without the elevated open-work ██████ of the nose. Dash the nose
from ███████'s marble Jove, and what a sorry █████████! Nevertheless,
Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his ███████████ are so
stately, that the same deficiency which in the ██████████ Jove were
hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A
nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on your ██████████████
voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble
███████████ of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a
nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will ██████ upon
█████████ even when beholding the mightiest royal ██████ on his throne.

In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This
aspect is sublime.

In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
morning. In the repose of the pasture, the ██████ brow of the bull has a
touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain ███████, the
elephant's brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as
that great golden seal ███████ by the German Emperors to their ███████.
It signifies--"God: done this day by my hand." But in most creatures,
nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of ██████
land lying along the snow line. Few are the █████████ which like
███████████'s or ██████████'s rise so high, and descend so low, that the
eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, ████████ mountain lakes; and all
above them in the forehead's wrinkles, you seem to track the ████████
thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the
snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and
mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so █████████ █████████,
that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity and the
dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living
nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is
revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper;
nothing but that one broad █████████ of a forehead, ███████ with
riddles; ██████ lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.
Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way
viewed its grandeur does not ████████ upon you so. In profile, you
plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of ██████.

But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written
a book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his
doing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his
pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale
been known to the young ██████ World, he would have been deified by
their child-██████ thoughts. They deified the █████████ of the Nile,
because the crocodile is ██████████; and the Sperm Whale has no
tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
██████████. If hereafter any highly ████████, poetical nation shall ████
back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and ████████
████████ them again in the now ███████████ sky; in the now █████████
hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, the great Sperm Whale
shall lord it.

███████████ ██████████ the wrinkled ███████ hieroglyphics. But there is
no Champollion to ████████ the Egypt of every man's and every being's
face. ███████████, like every other human science, is but a passing
fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty █████████, could
not read the ████████ peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings, how may ██████████ Ishmael hope to read the awful ███████ of
the Sperm Whale's brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you
can.



CHAPTER ██. The Nut.


If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a ██████, to the phrenologist his
brain seems that ███████████ circle which it is impossible to square.

In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
in length. ███████ the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base. But in life--as we have elsewhere seen--this inclined plane is
█████████ filled up, and almost ███████ by the enormous ██████████████
mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a ██████ to
bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater--in
another ██████ seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
depth--███████ the mere handful of this monster's brain. The brain is at
least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden
away behind its vast ████████, like the innermost ███████ within the
amplified ██████████████ of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
████████ in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange
folds, courses, and ████████████, to their apprehensions, it seems more
in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part
of him as the seat of his intelligence.

It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in
the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The
whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common
world.

If you ██████ his skull of its ██████ heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
the same point of view. Indeed, place this ████████ skull (██████ down
to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls, and you would
involuntarily ████████ it with them; and █████████ the depressions on
one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say--This
man had no self-esteem, and no ██████████. And by those █████████,
considered along with the ███████████ fact of his prodigious bulk and
power, you can best form to yourself the ██████, though not the most
████████████ conception of what the most exalted potency is.

But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain, you
████ it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine,
you will be struck with the resemblance of its █████████ to a strung
necklace of ███████ skulls, all bearing ██████████ resemblance to the
skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely
███████████ skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it
the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
the vertebrae of which he was ████████, in a sort of █████-███████, the
beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the █████████████ have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
██████████ through the ██████ canal. For I believe that much of a man's
character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin █████ of a spine
never yet ██████ a full and noble soul. I ███████ in my spine, as in the
firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.

Apply this spinal branch of ██████████ to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As
it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but
for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,
this canal is filled with much the same strangely ███████ substance--the
spinal cord--as the brain; and directly ████████████ with the brain.
And what is still more, for many feet after ████████ from the brain's
cavity, the spinal cord remains of an ████████████ girth, almost
equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically?
For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative █████████ of his
brain proper is more than ███████████ by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of his spinal cord.

But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
██████ mould of it. From its ████████ situation then, I should call this
high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale.
And that the great monster is ███████████, you will yet have reason to
know.



CHAPTER ██. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.


The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship ████████, ██████
De Deer, master, of ██████.

At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the Pacific.

For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the stern.

"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something
████████ held by the German. "Impossible!--a lamp-██████!"

"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's
coming off to make us our coffee, is the ██████; don't you see that big
███ can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all
right, is the Yarman."

"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."

However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be █████████ oil on the
whale-ground, and however much it may ██████████ ██████████ the old
proverb about carrying coals to █████████, yet sometimes such a thing
really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
███████████ conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
███████ what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well █████████ the name of
Jungfrau or the Virgin.

His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he ██████
round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-███████.

Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod's
keels. There were eight whales, an ███████ ███. Aware of their danger,
they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind,
rubbing their flanks as closely as so many █████ of horses in ███████.
They left a great, wide wake, as though continually █████████ a great
wide █████████ upon the sea.

Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
██████ old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish █████████████ ███████████ him, seemed █████████
with the ████████, or some other █████████. Whether this whale belonged
to the pod in advance, seemed ████████████; for it is not customary for
such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck
to their wake, though indeed their back water must have ████████ him,
because the white-bone or swell at his broad ██████ was a dashed one,
like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was
short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush,
and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean
██████████ in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried
extremity, causing the waters behind him to ████████.

"Who's got some █████████?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-████, I'm
afraid. Lord, think of having half an ████ of stomach-ache! ███████
winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind
I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale ███ so before?
it must be, he's lost his tiller."

As an █████████ ████████ bearing down the █████████ coast with a deck
████ of frightened horses, careens, ██████, rolls, and ███████ on her
way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
turning over on his ████████ rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a █████ for that wounded
arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.

"Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck. "Give way, or the
German will have him."

With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
for the time. At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the three
German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick's
boat still led the chase, though every moment ██████ by his foreign
██████. The only thing they feared, was, that from being already so
nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite
confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a ████████
███████ shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.

"The ██████████ and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he █████ and █████
me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!"--then
in his old intense whisper--"Give way, ██████████! Dog to it!"

"I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--"it's against
my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that ██████████
Yarman--Pull--won't ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do
ye love ██████? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come,
why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who's that been dropping an
anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed. ██████, here's
grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast there's
███████. This won't do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of
it is, men, will ye ████ fire or not?"

"Oh! see the ████ he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What
a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log! Oh! my lads, DO
spring--slap-█████ and ███████ for supper, you know, my lads--baked
clams and ███████--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred █████████--don't
lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh, won't ye pull for
your ████, my lads--such a ███! such a ██████! Don't ye love sperm?
There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a ████!--a whole bank! The bank
of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's that Yarman about now?"

At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view
of █████████ his rivals' way, and at the same time ████████████
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.

"The ██████████ Dutch ██████!" cried Stubb. "Pull now, men, like fifty
thousand line-of-battle-ship █████ of red-haired devils. What d'ye say,
Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
for the honour of old Gayhead? What d'ye say?"

"I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.

Fiercely, but evenly ███████ by the ██████ of the German, the Pequod's
three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
███████████ neared him. In that fine, loose, ██████████ attitude of
the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry
of, "There she ██████, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with
the Yarman! Sail over him!"

But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
their █████████, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a ████ which caught the blade
of his ███████ oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free
his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's boat was nigh to
█████████, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;--that was
a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a
mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.
An instant more, and all four boats were ████████████ in the whale's
immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the
███████ swell that he made.

It was a terrific, most ████████, and █████████ sight. The whale was
now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he █████ in his faltering flight,
and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the
sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I
seen a bird with ███████ wing making affrighted broken ███████ in the
air, vainly striving to escape the █████████ █████. But the bird has a
voice, and with █████████ cries will make known her fear; but the fear
of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was ███████ up and enchanted in him;
he had no voice, save that choking ███████████ through his spiracle,
and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his
amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to
appal the ████████ man who so ██████.

Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus ██████ of his game, Derick
█████ to ██████ what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,
ere the last chance would for ever escape.

But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to their feet,
and standing in a ████████ row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and
darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket
irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours of foam and white-fire! The
three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, ██████
the German's aside with such force, that both Derick and his ███████
harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.

"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--all
right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you know--relieve
██████████ travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
███████! Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin ███████ at the tail of a mad
██████! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a ███████ on
a plain--makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that
way; and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy
Jones--all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale
carries the everlasting ████!"

But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
████████████ sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
the ███████████ with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
soon ███████ the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue--the
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
██████ tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ███████ to sound,
for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of █████████ more
line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have
been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this "holding on," as it
is called; this ███████ up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril
of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the
best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken
whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the
enormous surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than
████ square feet--the pressure of the water is immense. We all know
what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even
here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,
bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at
least equal the weight of fifty ███████████. One whaleman has estimated
it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns,
and stores, and men on board.

As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single █████ or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
Seems it ████████ that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan
was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and
to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly said--"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that ██████ at him cannot
hold, the spear, the dart, nor the █████████: he █████████ iron as
straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as ███████;
he ████████ at the shaking of a spear!" This the creature? this he? Oh!
that █████████████ should follow the ████████. For with the strength
of a thousand ██████ in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the
mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!

In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!

"Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
vibrated in the water, distinctly ██████████ upwards to them, as by
magnetic █████, the life and death ██████ of the whale, so that every
oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden ██████
upwards, as a small ████████ will, when a dense ████ of white bears are
scared from it into the sea.

"Haul in! Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."

The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth
could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
ship's lengths of the hunters.

His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
there are certain ██████ or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities
it is to have an entire ███-████████ structure of the blood-vessels, so
that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly
█████ is at once begun upon his whole ████████ system; and when this is
heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant
streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant
and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and
bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will
flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible
hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and ██████████
drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,
they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only
at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted ████████ into the
air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him
had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was
█████████.

As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
beheld. As strange ████████ masses gather in the knot-holes of the
noblest oaks when █████████, so from the points which the whale's eyes
had once occupied, now █████████ blind █████, horribly pitiable to see.
But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his
blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the
gay ███████ and other merry-███████ of men, and also to ██████████ the
solemn churches that preach unconditional ███████████████ by all to all.
Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially █████████ a strangely
discoloured bunch or ████████████, the size of a ██████, low down on the
flank.

"A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."

"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"

But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an
████████ jet shot from this cruel wound, and ██████ by it into more than
sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury
blindly darted at the craft, ████████████ them and their ████████ crews
all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and ███████ the
bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by
loss of blood, that he ██████████ rolled away from the wreck he had
made; lay panting on his side, impotently ███████ with his stumped fin,
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up
the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most
███████, that last ████████ spout. As when by unseen hands the water
is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-███████
melancholy gurglings the spray-column ██████ and lowers to the
ground--so the last long dying spout of the whale.

Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures ████████. Immediately,
by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
that ere long every boat was a ████; the sunken whale being suspended a
few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when
the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was
strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain
that unless ████████████ upheld, the body would at once sink to the
bottom.

It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
the entire length of a ████████ harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,
on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,
with the flesh perfectly ██████ around them, and no prominence of any
kind to ██████ their place; therefore, there must needs have been
some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ██████████ alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And
when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before
America was discovered.

What other marvels might have been ████████ out of this monstrous
███████ there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
███████████, by the ship's being ███████████████ dragged over sideways
to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.
However, Starbuck, who had the ████████ of affairs, hung on to it to the
last; hung on to it so ██████████, indeed, that when at length the ship
would have been capsized, if still persisting in ███████ arms with the
body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was
the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and
cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime
everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the
deck was like walking up the steep ██████ roof of a house. The ship
groaned and ██████. Many of the ivory █████████ of her bulwarks and
██████ were started from their places, by the unnatural ███████████.
In vain handspikes and █████ were brought to bear upon the immovable
fluke-chains, to pry them ██████ from the ███████████; and so low
had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all
approached, while every moment whole tons of ███████████ seemed added to
the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.

"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in such
a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go
for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run
one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains."

"Knife? Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy
hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of ██████, were
given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific
snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.

Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
broken-hearted creatures, their ████ of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
noble ███████████, prematurely cut off in the warm █████ and May of
life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant
heroes do sometimes sink.

Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
███████████ the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances
where, after the █████ of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this
is obvious. █████ are █████████ in him; he swells to a prodigious
magnitude; becomes a sort of animal ███████. A line-of-battle ship could
hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among
the ████ of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they
fasten █████ to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone
down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.

It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
belonging to the species of ████████████ whales, because of its
incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is so
similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by █████████ fishermen it is often
mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in
valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail,
made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to
leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the ███████, my friend.



CHAPTER ██. The Honour and Glory of Whaling.


There are some ███████████ in which a careful ██████████████ is the true
method.

The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its
great ██████████████ and antiquity; and especially when I find so many
great ████-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection
that I myself belong, though but █████████████, to so ██████████ a
██████████.

The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and
to the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any ██████ intent. Those
were the ████████ days of our profession, when we only bore arms to
succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders. Every one
knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda,
the ████████ of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as
Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince
of whalemen, ██████████ advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered
and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic ███████, rarely
achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this
Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this
██████ story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast,
in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton
of a whale, which the city's ███████ and all the inhabitants asserted to
be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans
took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to █████ in triumph. What
seems most singular and ████████████ important in this story, is this:
it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

████ to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of St. George and
the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many
old ██████████ whales and ███████ are strangely ███████ together, and
often stand for each other. "Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale;
in truth, some ████████ of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
would much ████████ from the glory of the exploit had St. George but
encountered a crawling ███████ of the land, instead of doing battle
with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a
Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly
up to a whale.

Let not the modern paintings of this scene ███████ us; for though
the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a ███████-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
on land and the saint on █████████, yet considering the great ignorance
of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to ███████;
and considering that as in Perseus' case, St. George's whale might have
███████ up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
██████ by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ██████████ draughts of the scene, to
hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In
fact, placed before the ██████ and piercing truth, this whole story will
fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the ███████████, █████ by
name; who being planted before the ark of ██████, his horse's head and
both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or
fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even
a whaleman, is the ████████ ████████ of England; and by good rights, we
harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a
whale like their great ██████), let them never eye a Nantucketer with
disdain, since even in our woollen ██████ and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to St. George's ██████████ than they.

Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
antique ████████ and ███ ██████--that brawny ████ of █████████ good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be ██████. It nowhere
appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed,
from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I
claim him for one of our ████.

But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and ████ █████; certainly
they are very similar. If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?

Nor do heroes, ██████, ████████, and prophets alone comprise the whole
roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal
kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now
to be █████████ from the ███████, which gives us the dread ███████, one
of the three persons in the ███████ of the ███████; gives us this divine
Vishnoo himself for our Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten
earthly ████████████, has for ever set apart and ██████████ the whale.
When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to ████████
the world after one of its periodical ████████████, he gave birth to
Vishnoo, to ███████ over the work; but the █████, or mystical books,
whose ███████ would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
███████ the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
as a man who rides a horse is called a ████████?

Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a member-roll
for you! What club but the whaleman's can head off like that?



CHAPTER ██. Jonah ████████████ Regarded.


Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather ████████ this historical
story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks
and Romans, who, standing out from the ████████ pagans of their times,
equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and █████ and the
dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.

One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished with curious, ████████████ plates; one of which represented
Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true
with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this
saying, "A penny roll would █████ him"; his swallow is so very small.
But, to this, Bishop ████'s ████████████ answer is ready. It is not
necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the
whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the
Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of █████-tables, and
comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
█████████ himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right
Whale is █████████.

Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
reference to his ████████████ body and the whale's ███████ ██████. But
this objection likewise █████ to the ground, because a German █████████
████████ that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian ████████ turned
their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
been ███████ by other ███████████ ████████████, that when Jonah was
thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape
to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;
and, I would add, possibly called "The Whale," as some craft are
nowadays ██████████ the "Shark," the "Gull," the "Eagle." Nor have there
been wanting learned ██████████ who have ██████ that the whale mentioned
in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-█████████--an ████████ bag
of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a
watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But
he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I
remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean
Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'
███████ of Nineveh, a city on the ██████, very much more than three
days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.
How is that?

But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the
way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through
the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the
Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete
circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris
waters, near the ████ of Nineveh, being too ███████ for any whale to
swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's ██████████ the Cape of Good Hope
at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
████████ from ███████████ ████, its ███████ discoverer, and so make
modern history a ████.

But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason--a thing still more █████████████ in him, seeing
that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend ██████. For by a
Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh
███ the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal █████████████ of
the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly
enlightened █████ ████████ believe in the historical story of Jonah. And
some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris's Voyages,
speaks of a Turkish ██████ built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was
a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.



CHAPTER ██. ███████████.


To make them run easily and swiftly, the █████ of carriages are
anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat; they ██████ the bottom. Nor is it
to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing
his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling
under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the
████████████ as though diligently seeking to insure a ████ of hair from
the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some
particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.

Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,
as of Cleopatra's ██████ from ██████.

Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost. By great
████████, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
flight, with added █████████. Such █████████████ strainings upon the
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably ███████ it. It became
██████████ to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But
to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furious. What then remained?

Of all the wondrous devices and ███████████, the ████████ of hand and
countless ██████████, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
none exceed that fine █████████ with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
sword, or broad sword, in all its █████████ ██████ nothing like it. It
is only indispensable with an ██████████ running whale; its grand
fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
██████████ darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve
feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,
and also of a lighter material--pine. It is furnished with a small rope
called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to
the hand after darting.

But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
the harpoon may be ██████████ in the same way with the lance, yet it
is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,
on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compared with the lance, which in effect become serious █████████. As a
general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any
pitchpoling comes into play.

Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate ████████ and
██████████ in the direst ███████████, was specially qualified to █████
in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
flying boat; wrapt in ██████ foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.
Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its
length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb ███████████ gathers up
the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his
grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before
his █████████'s middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering
him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby
elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his
palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a ███████,
balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
███████, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of
sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

"That drove the ██████ out of him!" cried Stubb. "'Tis July's immortal
Fourth; all fountains must run wine █████! Would now, it were old
███████ ███████, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old ███████████! Then,
Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a ███████ to the jet, and we'd drink
round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd ████ choice punch in the
spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl █████ the
living stuff."

Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
the spear returning to its master like a █████████ held in ███████
█████. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
slackened, and the ██████████ dropping astern, folds his hands, and
mutely watches the monster die.



CHAPTER ██. The Fountain.


That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of ages
before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,
and ██████████ and ██████████ the gardens of the deep, as with so
many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
whale, watching these ███████████ and █████████--that all this should
be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter
minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this █████████ day of December, A.D.
1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings
are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is surely a
noteworthy thing.

Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
██████████. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is
combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod
might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular
lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by ████████ the
disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for
his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree
breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm
Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and
what is still more, his ████████ has no connexion with his mouth. No, he
breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.

If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a ████████
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it █████████ from the air a
certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
blood imparts to the blood its █████████ principle, I do not think I
shall ███; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
███████ with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or
so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
██████████-like vessels, which vessels, when he █████ the surface, are
completely distended with ██████████ blood. So that for an hour or more,
a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a ███████ stock of vitality in
him, just as the █████ crossing the █████████ desert carries a surplus
supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary ████████.
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is ████████████; and that the
supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more
cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable █████████ of
that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase
it. This is what I mean. If ██████████, upon rising to the surface, the
Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform
with all his other unmolested ███████. Say he stays eleven minutes, and
jets seventy times, that is, ████████ seventy ███████; then whenever he
rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to
a minute. Now, if after he ███████ a few breaths you alarm him, so that
he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular
█████████ of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he
finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that
in different ███████████ these █████ are different; but in any one
they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out, unless it be to █████████ his █████████ of air, ere
descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal ███████ of the chase. For
not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing
a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!

In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only ███████
for two or three ██████████; so that whatever other business he has to
attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.

It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
it could ██████████ be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then
I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
seems ███████████ in him; for the only thing about him that at all
answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so ███████
with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of
smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or
whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
███████████. But what does he want of them? No roses, no ███████, no
Cologne-water in the sea.

Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is furnished
with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward █████████ of
air or the upward █████████ of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely ███████,
he █████ through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?
Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
this world, unless forced to ███████ out something by way of getting a
living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent ████████!

Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it
is for the ██████████ of air, and for several feet laid along,
horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
to one side; this curious canal is very much like a ███-pipe laid down
in a city on one side of a street. But the question ███████ whether this
gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the
Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the ███████ breath, or whether that
exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
██████████ through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly
communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this
is for the purpose of ███████████ water through the spiracle. Because
the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he
accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath
the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if
you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find
that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the ███████
of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.

But why ██████ one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
█████████ of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in
it, and yet be █████████ as to what it is precisely.

The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water █████████
all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they
are not those identical drops █████████████ lodged in the spout-hole
fissure, which is ███████████ into the summit of the whale's head? For
even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then,
the whale always carries a small █████ of water on his head, as under
a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rain.

Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your ███████ to
this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will
often happen, your skin will ██████████ █████, from the █████████ of
the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer
contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,
or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
█████ it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt
it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.
The wisest thing the ████████████ can do then, it seems to me, is to let
this deadly spout alone.

Still, we can ███████████, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides
other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an ██████████
fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am
convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
Plato, ██████, the Devil, Jupiter, █████, and so on, there always goes
up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
thoughts. While composing a little ████████ on Eternity, I had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw █████████ there,
a curious involved ███████ and ██████████ in the atmosphere over my
head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,
after six cups of hot tea in my thin ████████ █████, of an August noon;
this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.

And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
head ████████ by a ██████ of vapour, ██████████ by his incommunicable
██████████████, and that vapour--as you will sometimes see it--█████████
by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only █████████
vapour. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, ██████████ my fog with a
heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
but doubts or ███████, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts
of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
███████████ makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
███████ them both with equal eye.



CHAPTER ██. The Tail.


Other poets have ███████ the ███████ of the soft eye of the ████████,
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never ███████; less celestial, I
celebrate a tail.

Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of
the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The
compact round body of its root ███████ into two broad, firm, flat palms
or flukes, gradually ████████ away to less than an inch in thickness.
At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly ███████, then sideways
██████ from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In
no living thing are the lines of beauty more ███████████ defined than in
the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the
full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.

The entire member seems a dense ██████ bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you find that three distinct ██████ ███████ it:--upper,
middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layers. This ██████ structure, as much as
anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the ███████ of old Roman
walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antique, and which ███████████ contribute so much to the
great strength of the ███████.

But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
the whole bulk of the leviathan is ████ over with a warp and woof of
████████ fibres and █████████, which passing on either side the █████
and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.

Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to ███████ the graceful
███████ of its motions; where █████████████ of ease undulates through
a ████████ of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
appalling beauty from it. Real strength never ███████ beauty or ███████,
but it often ███████ it; and in everything ██████████ beautiful,
strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that
all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its
charm would be gone. As devout ████████ lifted the linen sheet from the
naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When ██████ paints even God
the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
████████████████ Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
successfully ████████; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all
██████████, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, ████████
one of ██████████ and █████████, which on all hands it is ████████, form
the peculiar practical virtues of his █████████.

Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
███████ in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
be in, its ████████ are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no
fairy's arm can █████████ it.

Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
███████████; Second, when used as a ████ in battle; Third, in sweeping;
Fourth, in ██████████; Fifth, in ███████ flukes.

First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
████████. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
whale, his tail is the sole means of ██████████. Scroll-wise coiled
forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this
which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when
furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.

Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
█████████ with man, he chiefly and ██████████████ uses his tail. In
striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
salvation lies in ███████ it; but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale
boat, and the elasticity of its █████████, a cracked rib or a dashed
plank or two, a sort of ██████ in the side, is generally the most
serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the
fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off
a frock, and the hole is stopped.

Third: I cannot ███████████ it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the ██████████ of the
elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping, when in ████████ ██████████ the whale with a certain soft
████████ moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface
of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and all. What ██████████ there is in that preliminary touch!
Had this tail any ██████████ power, I should straightway bethink me of
██████████' elephant that so frequented the ██████-market, and with
low salutations presented ████████ to ███████, and then ████████ their
zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet
another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk
and extracted the dart.

Fourth: Stealing ████████ upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas, you find him ██████ from the vast corpulence
of his dignity, and ██████-like, he █████ on the ocean as if it were a
hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of
his tail are flirted high into the air; then ███████ the surface, the
██████████ ██████████ resounds for miles. You would almost think a great
gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light ██████ of vapour
from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was
the smoke from the touch-hole.

Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime ██████--somewhere
else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the
████████ sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth
his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in
the ███████, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the
██████████. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
█████████ sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in ██████, the home of
the fire worshippers. As ███████ ██████████ █████████ of the African
elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout
of all beings. For according to King ████, the military elephants of
antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence.

The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a ███████
to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the
stalk of a ████. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as
the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have
one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews
into the air, very much as an Indian juggler ██████ his balls.*


*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to
the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious
similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant
will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,
jet it forth in a stream.


The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I ███████ my █████████
to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they
would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an
extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,
that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-█████
signs and ███████; that the whale, indeed, by these ███████
█████████████ conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other
motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and
unaccountable to his most experienced █████████. ███████ him how I may,
then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know
not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more,
how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back
parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I
cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will about
his face, I say again he has no face.



CHAPTER ██. The Grand ██████.


The long and narrow █████████ of ███████, extending south-eastward from
the ███████████ of ██████, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
Sumatra, Java, █████, and Timor; which, with many others, form a
vast mole, or ███████, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia,
and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly ███████
oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
for the ███████████ of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the
straits of █████ and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels
bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.

Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, ██████████ by that bold green
promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
considering the █████████████ wealth of spices, and █████, and ██████,
and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
appearance, however ███████████, of being ███████ from the all-grasping
western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied
with those domineering ██████████ which guard the entrances to the
Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the █████, these
█████████ do not demand the ██████████ homage of lowered top-sails from
the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
and Java, freighted with the costliest ███████ of the east. But while
they freely █████ a ██████████ like this, they do by no means ████████
their claim to more solid ███████.

Time out of mind the piratical █████ of the Malays, lurking among
the low ██████ █████ and ██████ of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody █████████████ they
have received at the hands of European cruisers, the ████████ of these
████████ has of late been somewhat █████████; yet, even at the present
day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
those waters, have been █████████████ boarded and ████████.

With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
thence, cruising ██████████, over waters known to be frequented here and
there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the ██████████ Islands, and
gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there.
By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the
known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending
upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled
in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the
sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might most
reasonably be presumed to be ████████ it.

But how now? in this █████ quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now,
the ██████-running sun has █████ within his fiery ring, and needs
no ██████████ but what's in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the
whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a
whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
█████████; not altogether with ████████ pig-lead and █████████. She
carries years' water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to
drink before the ████████ fluid, but yesterday ██████ off in casks, from
the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may
have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score
of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted
one █████ of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had
come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"

Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of
the ground, ██████████, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more
and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
██████████ to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the
land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with █████████ nostrils
the fresh ████████ was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
descried. Almost ██████████ all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of
singular ████████████ ███████ us.

But here be it ████████, that owing to the █████████ activity with which
of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
█████████ so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if
numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual
██████████ and protection. To this ███████████ of the Sperm Whale into
such immense ████████, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the
best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months
together, without being ███████ by a single spout; and then be suddenly
saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.

Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great ██████████, embracing one half of the level horizon,
a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the █████
drooping boughs of a ██████, the single forward-slanting spout of the
Sperm Whale presents a thick curled ████ of white mist, continually
rising and falling away to leeward.

Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, ████████████ curling up into the
air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of ██████ haze, showed
like the thousand cheerful ████████ of some dense ██████████, descried
of a █████ ████████ morning, by some horseman on a height.

As marching armies approaching an ██████████ ██████ in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.

Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only ██████
into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with
stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
directing attention to something in our wake.

Corresponding to the ████████ in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something
like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
go; for they constantly ███████, without finally disappearing. █████████
his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole,
crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the
sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"

As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
fairly have entered the straits, these ████████ Asiatics were now in hot
pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift
Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very
kind of these tawny ███████████████ to assist in ████████ her on to
her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and ██████ to her, that they
were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his
forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed
his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in
which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that
gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that
same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;
and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and
inhuman ███████████ devils were ██████████ cheering him on with their
curses;--when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's
brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide has been ███████ it, without being able to drag the firm
thing from its place.

But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
Pequod at last shot by the vivid green ████████ Point on the Sumatra
side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
harpooneers seemed more to ██████ that the swift whales had been gaining
upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so ████████████ gained
upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at
length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;
and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But
no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm
Whale, become ████████ of the three keels that were after them,--though
as yet a mile in their rear,--than they ███████ again, and forming
in close ranks and ██████████, so that their spouts all looked like
flashing lines of stacked ████████, moved on with █████████ velocity.

Stripped to our ██████ and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,
when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave █████████
token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert ████████████, which, when the fishermen perceive
it in the whale, they say he is ███████. The compact martial columns
in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
broken up in one measureless ████; and like King █████' elephants in the
Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation.
In all directions █████████ in vast irregular circles, and █████████
swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they
plainly betrayed their ███████████ of panic. This was still more
strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely █████████
as it were, helplessly floated like water-██████ dismantled ships on the
sea. Had these Leviathans been but a █████ of simple sheep, pursued over
the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced
such █████████ dismay. But this occasional timidity is ██████████████
of almost all ███████ creatures. Though ███████ together in tens of
thousands, the lion-maned █████████ of the West have fled before a
solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when ██████
together in the sheepfold of a ███████'s pit, they will, at the
slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the ███████, crowding,
trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales
before us, for there is no █████ of the beasts of the earth which is not
infinitely ███████ by the madness of men.

Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one
lone whale on the █████████ of the shoal. In about three minutes' time,
Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight
for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the
whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and
indeed is almost always more or less ███████████; yet does it present
one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift
monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid
adieu to ███████████ life and only exist in a delirious █████.

As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides ███████ as we flew, by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
like a ship ██████ by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed.

But not a bit ███████, Queequeg steered us ████████; now ████████ off
from this monster directly across our route in advance; now ██████ away
from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time
to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their ██████
duty was now altogether █████████ with. They chiefly attended to the
shouting part of the business. "Out of the way, Commodore!" cried one,
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
and for an instant threatened to █████ us. "Hard down with your tail,
there!" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
calmly ███████ himself with his own fan-like extremity.

All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
by the Nantucket Indians, called ██████. Two thick squares of wood
of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
being ██████, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly
among gallied whales that this █████ is used. For then, more whales
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm
whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must
kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing
them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it
is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into ███████████. Our boat
was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully
darted, and we saw the whales ████████████ running off, ████████ by the
enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like
███████████ with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the
act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one
of the █████ of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it
away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from
under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we
stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for
the time.

It had been next to impossible to dart these ███████-harpoons, were
it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly
diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the
circumference of commotion, the direful █████████ seemed waning. So that
when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways
████████; then, with the tapering force of his ███████ ████████, we
glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if
from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here
the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard
but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth
satin-like surface, called a █████, produced by the subtle moisture
thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now
in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every
commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the ███████ of
the outer concentric circles, and saw successive ████ of whales, eight
or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of
horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a ███████
circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have
gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing
whales, more immediately surrounding the ███████ axis of the herd, no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for
a breach in the living wall that ██████ us in; the wall that had only
admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,
we were occasionally visited by small tame ████ and calves; the women
and children of this ██████ host.

Now, █████████ of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be
deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the
herd had hitherto █████████ them from learning the precise cause of its
stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
innocent and █████████████; however it may have been, these smaller
whales--now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
lake--evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
█████████ panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household
dogs they came █████████ round us, right up to our gunwales, and
touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
████████████ them. Queequeg ██████ their foreheads; Starbuck █████████
their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
time refrained from darting it.

But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
in those watery ██████, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to
become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while ████████ will calmly
and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different
lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal ███████████, be still
███████████ ████████ upon some unearthly reminiscence;--even so did the
young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
we were but a bit of ████████ in their new-born sight. Floating on their
sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
have ████████ some ████████ feet in length, and some six feet in
girth. He was a little ██████; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet
recovered from that ███████ position it had so ██████ occupied in the
maternal ████████; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final
spring, the ██████ whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate
side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
plaited ████████ appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign
parts.

"Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast! him
fast!--Who line him! Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one little!"

"What ████ ye, man?" cried Starbuck.

"Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.

As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
the slackened curling line █████████ rising and ██████████ towards the
air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the █████████ cord of ██████
Leviathan, by which the young ███ seemed still ████████ to its dam. Not
seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with
the maternal end loose, becomes █████████ with the hempen one, so that
the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the ████████ secrets of the seas
seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan
amours in the deep.*


*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike
most other fish, breeds █████████████ at all seasons; after a █████████
which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a
time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an ████ and
█████:--a ███████████ provided for in suckling by two █████, curiously
████████, one on each side of the ████; but the ███████ themselves
██████ upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a
nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk
and blood ███████████ █████████ the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet
and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with ████████████.
When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales ██████ MORE ███████.


And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of ██████████████
and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly ███████ in all peaceful ████████████; yea, ████████ ████████
in █████████ and delight. But even so, amid the █████████ Atlantic of
my being, do I myself still for ever █████████ ███████ in mute calm; and
while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
deep inland there I still █████ me in eternal mildness of joy.

Meanwhile, as we thus lay █████████, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in ████████ the whales on the ████████ of the host; or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of
room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert, to seek to █████████ him, as it were, by █████████ or
███████ his gigantic tail-██████. It is done by darting a short-handled
cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again.
A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along
with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of
the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone
mounted desperado ██████, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay
wherever he went.

But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to
inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the
intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that
by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had
become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning
through the water, violently ████████ with his flexible tail, and
tossing the keen spade about him, ████████ and murdering his own
comrades.

This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
heave and swell; the █████████ bridal-chambers and █████████ vanished;
in more and more contracting ██████ the whales in the more central
circles began to swim in ██████████ clusters. Yes, the long calm was
█████████. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,
as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck
and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.

"Oars! Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"█████ your
oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! █████ him off,
you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him! Stand up--stand
up, and stay so! Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their backs--scrape
them!--scrape away!"

The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black █████, leaving a
narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly,
and at the same time earnestly watching for another ██████. After many
similar hair-breadth ███████, we at last swiftly glided into what had
just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales,
all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was ███████
purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows
to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by
the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close
by.

Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
███████ together at last in one dense body, they then ███████ their
██████ flight with █████████ fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but
the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales
might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had
killed and ██████. The waif is a ████████ pole, two or three of which
are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand,
are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to
mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should
the boats of any other ship draw near.

The result of this lowering was somewhat ████████████ of that sagacious
saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish. Of all the
drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for
the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other
craft than the Pequod.



CHAPTER ██. ███████ and Schoolmasters.


The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause ████████ those
vast ████████████.

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
composed almost entirely of ███████, and those █████████ none but young
vigorous █████, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.

In ████████ attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, ███████
his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious ███████, swimming about
over the watery world, █████████████ accompanied by all the ███████
and ███████████ of the █████. The contrast between this Ottoman and
his ██████████ is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not
more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a █████
yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
whole they are hereditarily entitled to ██████████.

It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
█████████. Like ████████████, they are for ever on the move in leisurely
search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower
of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from
spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all
unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have ███████ up and
down the █████████ of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental
waters in ████████████ of the cool season there, and so evade the other
excessive temperature of the year.

When serenely advancing on one of these ████████, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a ████ eye on his
interesting family. Should any █████████████ ████ young Leviathan coming
that way, presume to draw ██████████████ close to one of the ladies,
with what prodigious fury the ██████ ███████ him, and ██████ him away!
High times, indeed, if ████████████ young █████ like him are to be
permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the
Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious ████████ out of his bed;
for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the
most terrible █████ among their rival ████████; just so with the whales,
who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with
their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving
for the supremacy like ████ that █████████ ██████████ their ███████. Not
a few are captured having the deep █████ of these encounters,--████████
heads, broken teeth, █████████ fins; and in some instances, wrenched and
██████████ mouths.

But supposing the ███████ of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very █████████ to watch
that lord. Gently he ██████████ his vast bulk among them again and
██████ there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,
like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too ██████
of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the
sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
like certain other ██████████ ██████ lovers that might be named, my Lord
Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the █████; and so,
being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the
world; every baby an ██████. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardour
of youth declines; as years and █████ ████████; as reflection █████
her solemn pauses; in short, as a general █████████ █████████ the █████
Turk; then a love of ease and virtue █████████ the love for ███████; our
Ottoman enters upon the ████████, █████████, ██████████ stage of life,
█████████, ████████ the harem, and grown to an █████████, sulky old
soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and █████████ saying his
prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his ███████ errors.

Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however admirably
█████████, that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad
inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title,
schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed
upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who first
thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the ███████ of
██████, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that
famous █████████ was in his ███████ days, and what was the nature of
those ██████ ███████ he ██████████ into some of his ██████.

The same ████████████ and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
███████ himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is
called--proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel █████,
he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
she keeps so many moody secrets.

The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while
those female whales are ██████████████████ timid, the young males, or
forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all Leviathans, and ████████████ the most dangerous to encounter;
excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a █████ ████.

The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like
a mob of young ██████████, they are full of fight, fun, and ██████████,
tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
prudent ███████████ would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this ██████████ though,
and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in
quest of ███████████, that is, ██████.

Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the █████. Say you strike a
Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike
a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
themselves to fall a prey.



CHAPTER ██. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.


The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and ███████████ of the whale
fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly █████████
many █████ █████████████, all partaking of this one grand feature. For
example,--after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale,
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
drifting far away to leeward, be ███████ by a second whaler, who, in a
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus
the most █████████ and violent ████████ would often arise between
the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
undisputed law ██████████ to all cases.

Perhaps the only ██████ whaling ████ ██████████ by ███████████
█████████, was that of Holland. It was ███████ by the States-General in
A.D. ████. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
law, yet the American fishermen have been their own ███████████ and
███████ in this matter. They have provided a system which for █████
comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's ████████ and the By-laws of
the Chinese Society for the Suppression of ████████ with other People's
Business. Yes; these laws might be ████████ on a Queen Anne's farthing,
or the ████ of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.

I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.

II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can ███████ catch it.

But what plays the mischief with this ████████ code is the admirable
███████ of it, which necessitates a vast volume of ████████████ to
███████ it.

First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all
████████████ by the ████████ or █████████,--a mast, an oar, a nine-inch
cable, a █████████ wire, or a strand of ██████, it is all the same.
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other
recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party ███████ it plainly
evince their ███████ at any time to take it alongside, as well as their
intention so to do.

These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder ██████--the
████-upon-█████████ of the ████. True, among the more upright and
honourable whalemen ██████████ are always made for peculiar cases,
where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
others are by no means so ██████████.

Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-██████ █████████
in England, wherein the ██████████ set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
their lives, obliged to ███████ not only their lines, but their boat
itself. Ultimately the ██████████ (the crew of another ship) came up
with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally ████████████ it
before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
████████████ with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs'
teeth, and assured them that by way of ████████ to the deed he had done,
he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained
attached to the whale at the time of the ███████. Wherefore the
plaintiffs now ████ for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,
harpoons, and boat.

Mr. ███████ was counsel for the defendants; Lord ████████████ was
the judge. In the course of the ███████, the █████ Erskine went on
to ██████████ his position, by alluding to a ██████ ████. ███.
case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
███████████, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
the course of years, repenting of that step, he ██████████ an action to
recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he
then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the
great ██████ of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet
abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore
when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that
subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have
been found sticking in her.

Now in the present case Erskine █████████ that the examples of the whale
and the lady were ████████████ illustrative of each other.

These █████████, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the boat, he
███████ it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it
to save their lives; but that with regard to the ████████████ whale,
harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)
████████ a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
the fish; ergo, the █████████ articles were theirs.

A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
possibly object to it. But ████████ up to the primary rock of the
matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in
the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,
I say, will, on reflection, be found the ████████████ of all human
█████████████; for notwithstanding its complicated ███████ of sculpture,
the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two
█████ to stand on.

Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law:
that is, ██████████ of how the thing came into possession? But often
possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
Russian █████ and ██████████ ██████ but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is
the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last
████ but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder ██████████ ███████'s marble mansion
with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the
███████ ████████ which ████████, the ██████, gets from poor █████████,
the bankrupt, on a ████ to keep Woebegone's family from starvation;
what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the ██████████ of
████████'s income of ████,000 seized from the █████ bread and cheese
of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
Fast-Fish? What are the ████ of ██████'s hereditary towns and ███████
but Fast-Fish? What to that █████████ harpooneer, John Bull, is poor
███████, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic ██████, Brother
████████, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not
Possession the whole of the law?

But if the ████████ of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable,
the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
███████████████ and universally applicable.

What was America in ████ but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?
What was Poland to the Czar? What ██████ to the Turk? What India
to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All
Loose-Fish.

What are the Rights of Man and the █████████ of the World but
Loose-Fish? What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is
the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to
the ostentatious █████████ ██████████ are the thoughts of ████████ but
Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what
are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?



CHAPTER ██. Heads or Tails.


"De ██████ ████ ████████, ██ ███ ██████ █████, et ██████ ██████."
███████, L. 3, █. 3.


Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land, the King, as █████████ Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A ████████ which,
in the whale, is much like ███████ an apple; there is no ████████████
remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in
force in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange ███████
touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of
in a separate chapter, on the same █████████ principle that ███████
the English ████████ to be at the expense of a separate ███, specially
reserved for the █████████████ of royalty. In the first place, in
curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in
force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within
the last two years.

It seems that some honest mariners of █████, or Sandwich, or some one
of the ██████ Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
████████ a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the
████████████ of a sort of █████████ or beadle, called a Lord ██████.
Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal
██████████ incident to the Cinque Port territories become by ██████████
his. By some ███████ this office is called a ████████. But not so.
Because the Lord Warden is ██████ employed at times in ███████ his
perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
them.

Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their ████ legs, had wearily hauled their fat
fish high and dry, promising themselves a good ████ from the precious
oil and bone; and in ███████ ███████ rare tea with their wives, and good
ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up
steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with
a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale's head,
he says--"Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it
as the Lord Warden's." Upon this the poor mariners in their ██████████
consternation--so truly English--knowing not what to say, fall to
vigorously ██████████ their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing
from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter,
or at all ██████ the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy
of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scratching about for
his ideas, made bold to speak,

"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"

"The Duke."

"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"

"It is his."

"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is
all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
pains but our ████████?"

"It is his."

"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
getting a livelihood?"

"It is his."

"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
this whale."

"It is his."

"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"

"It is his."

In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
██████████ received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest █████████
of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to
take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend
gentleman) would decline meddling with other people's business. Is
this the still ████████ old man, standing at the corners of the three
████████, on all hands ████████ alms of beggars?

It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
Duke to the whale was a █████████ one from the Sovereign. We must needs
inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with
that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But ███████ gives
us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to
the King and Queen, "because of its superior excellence." And by the
████████ commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
matters.

But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
for that, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-████████, an old King's Bench
author, one William ██████, thus ███████████: "Ye tail is ye Queen's,
that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone." Now this
was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or
Right whale was largely used in ladies' ███████. But this same bone
is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for
a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a ███████, to be
presented with a tail? An ███████████ meaning may lurk here.

There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the whale
and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain ███████████, and
nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue.
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish, which, ████████████ regarded, may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed ████████████. And thus there
seems a reason in all things, even in law.



CHAPTER ██. The Pequod Meets The Rose-███.


"In vain it was to rake for ███████████ in the paunch of this Leviathan,
insufferable █████ denying not inquiry." SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.


It was a week or two after the last whaling scene █████████, and when we
were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many
noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant ███████████ than the
three █████ of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was
smelt in the sea.

"I will ███ something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts are
some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
would keel up before long."

Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
lay a ship, whose ██████ sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that ███████, and
hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that
has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an ██████████████ corpse.
It may well be conceived, what an unsavory ████ such a mass must
██████; worse than an ████████ city in the plague, when the living are
incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded
by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to ████ alongside of it.
Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that
the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and
by no means of the nature of █████-of-rose.

Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more
of a ███████ than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of
those █████████████ whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort
of prodigious dyspepsia, or ███████████; leaving their ███████ bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
whales in general.

The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed
he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales.

"There's a pretty fellow, now," he ███████████ laughed, standing in the
ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye! I well know that these ████████
of █████████ are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
tallow candles, and cases of ████████, foreseeing that all the oil they
will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's ████ into; aye, we all
know these things; but look ye, here's a ██████ that is content with our
████████, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with
scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor
devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make him a present
of a little oil for dear charity's sake. For what oil he'll get from
that drugged whale there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not
in a condemned ████. And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get
more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than
he'll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, █████████.
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It's worth trying. Yes,
I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.

By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
or no, the Pequod was now fairly █████████ in the smell, with no hope of
escaping except by its ████████ up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the ████████ French
taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper
spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a
symmetrical folded ████ of a bright red colour. Upon her head ██████, in
large gilt letters, he read "██████ de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud;
and this was the romantic name of this ████████ ship.

Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the ███████████, yet
the word ROSE, and the ███████ figure-head put together, sufficiently
explained the whole to him.

"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that will
do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"

Now in order to hold direct █████████████ with the people on deck, he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to
the blasted whale; and so talk over it.

Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
██████--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that
speak English?"

"Yes," rejoined a ████████-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
the chief-mate.

"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"

"WHAT whale?"

"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?

"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot ███████! White Whale--no."

"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."

Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he ███████ his two hands
into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir! No!" Upon which Ahab retired, and
Stubb returned to the Frenchman.

He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had █████ his nose in a sort of
bag.

"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb. "Broke it?"

"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!" answered
the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
much. "But what are you holding YOURS for?"

"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it?
Air rather ████████, I should say; throw us a bunch of ██████, will ye,
Bouton-de-Rose?"

"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the ███████████,
flying into a sudden passion.

"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those
whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But ██████ aside, though; do
you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a ████ in his
whole carcase."

"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe
it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne ████████████ before. But
come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll
get out of this █████ scrape."

"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb,
and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow
and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their
noses ████████ █████████ from their faces like so many jib-█████.
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the
mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the
plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
nostrils. Others having broken the █████ of their pipes almost short
off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
constantly filled their olfactories.

Stubb was struck by a shower of ████████ and █████████ proceeding from
the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ████ from within.
This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain █████████████
against the proceedings of the day, had ███████ himself to the Captain's
round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the ████; but still, could
not help yelling out his entreaties and ████████████ at times.

Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
expressed his ███████████ of his Captain as a █████████ █████████,
who had brought them all into so unsavory and ████████████ a pickle.
Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore
held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite █████ and
confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
for both █████████████ and ██████████ the Captain, without his at all
dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan
of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an ███████████'s office, was
to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as
for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come █████████ in
him during the interview.

By this time their destined ██████ appeared from his cabin. He was a
small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton ██████ vest
with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
aspect of ████████████ between them.

"What shall I say to him first?" said he.

"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, "you
may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of ███████ to me,
though I don't pretend to be a judge."

"He says, ████████," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they had brought alongside."

Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.

"What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.

"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a
██████."

"He ████ and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he ████████ us,
as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."

Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose
the cables and chains █████████ the whales to the ship.

"What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
them.

"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in
fact, tell him I've ███████ him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
else."

"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to
us."

Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by ████████ Stubb down into his
cabin to drink a bottle of ████████.

"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the interpreter.

"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go."

"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but
that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
it's so calm they won't █████."

By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his
boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats,
then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb ████████████ towed
away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously ████████ out a most
unusually long tow-line.

Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb ███████ to cast off from the whale;
hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of
his ██████████, at once proceeded to ████ the █████ of his ███████████
cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an ██████████ in the
body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
███████ a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and
███████ buried in fat English ████. His boat's crew were all in high
excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as
gold-hunters.

And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning
to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when
suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint
stream of ███████, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without
being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with
another, without at all blending with it for a time.

"I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"

Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls
of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich ███████ old
cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily ████ it with
your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good
friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any ████████.
Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was ███████████ lost in the
sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for
█████████ Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board,
else the ship would bid them good bye.



CHAPTER ██. Ambergris.


Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
an article of commerce, that in ████ a certain Nantucket-born Captain
Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French ████████ for
grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though
at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland
█████, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,
amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, ████████ substance, used for
mouth-pieces to pipes, for █████ and █████████; but ambergris is soft,
████, and so highly fragrant and █████, that it is largely used in
█████████, in ████████, precious candles, hair-███████, and ███████.
The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to █████, for the same
purpose that ████████████ is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine
█████████ drop a few ██████ into ██████, to flavor it.

Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should ██████
themselves with an essence found in the ██████████ bowels of a sick
whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and
by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such
a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by █████████████ three or four
boat loads of █████████'s pills, and then running out of harm's way, as
laborers do in ████████ rocks.

I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain
hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors'
trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing
more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.

Now that the ████████████ of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
saying of St. Paul in ███████████, about ██████████ and incorruption;
how that we are ████ in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise
call to mind that saying of ██████████ about what it is that maketh
the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental █████████████ stages, is the
worst.

I should like to conclude the chapter with the above ██████, but cannot,
owing to my anxiety to █████ a charge often made against whalemen,
and which, in the estimation of some already ██████ minds, might be
considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of
the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the ██████████
█████████ has been █████████, that the vocation of whaling is throughout
a ██████████, ██████ business. But there is another thing to █████. They
hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this ██████ ██████
█████████?

I opine, that it is plainly █████████ to the first arrival of the
Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as
the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in
small bits, thrust it through the ████ holes of large casks, and carry
it home in that manner; the █████████ of the season in those Icy Seas,
and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding
any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,
and █████████ one of these whale ██████████, in the Greenland ████, a
savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from ██████████ an
old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.

I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
times, of a Dutch village called █████████████ or ███████████, which
latter name is the one used by the learned ████ Von █████, in his great
work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name ███████ (█████,
fat; ████, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without
being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of
████████, fat-kettles, and oil █████; and when the works were in full
operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is
quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four
years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,
perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the
state that it is ██████, the oil is nearly █████████. The truth is, that
living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by
no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the
people of the middle ages affected to ██████ a ███ in the company, by
the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
when, as a general thing, he ██████ such high health; taking abundance
of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the
open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water
█████████ a perfume, as when a musk-███████ lady ███████ her dress in a
warm parlor. What then shall I █████ the Sperm Whale to for █████████,
considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with
jewelled tusks, and ████████ with █████, which was led out of an Indian
town to do honour to Alexander the Great?



CHAPTER ██. The Castaway.


It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew; an
event most ██████████; and which ended in providing the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered ██████ might prove her own.

Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats'
crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or ████████
wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-██████. It
was so in the Pequod with the little negro ██████ by nick-name, Pip by
████████████. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember
his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.

In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black ████ and a
white one, of equal ████████████, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
one █████████ ████. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
██████ in his ██████████, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly ██████████ peculiar to
his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all ████████ and ███████████ with
█████, freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year's ████████
should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of █████ and
New Year's Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
brilliant, for even blackness has its ██████████; behold yon ████████
ebony, panelled in king's ████████. But Pip loved life, and all life's
peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he
had somehow █████████████ become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
subdued in him, in the end was destined to be ███████ █████████ by
strange wild fires, that ████████████ showed him off to ten times the
natural lustre with which in his native ███████ ██████ in ███████████,
he had once █████████ many a ███████'s ██████ on the green; and at
█████████ even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon
into one star-██████ tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day,
suspended against a blue-██████ neck, the pure-███████ ███████ drop
will █████████ glow; yet, when the cunning ████████ would show you
the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy
ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural
gases. Then come out those fiery ███████████, infernally superb; then
the evil-blazing diamond, once the ████████ symbol of the crystal skies,
looks like some crown-jewel ██████ from the King of Hell. But let us to
the story.

It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
chanced so to ██████ his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.

The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much ███████████;
but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
therefore came off not altogether █████████████; though Stubb observing
him, took care, afterwards, to ██████ him to cherish his ██████████████
to the utmost, for he might often find it ███████.

Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary ███, which
happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
line coming against his chest, he ████████ it overboard with him, so as
to become entangled in it, when at last ████████ into the water. That
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks
of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
several turns around his chest and neck.

Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He
hated Pip for a ████████. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
exclaimed ███████████████, "Cut?" Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
half a minute, this entire thing happened.

"Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
saved.

So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was ████████
by yells and ███████████ from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
irregular ████████ to █████████, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip ██████████; and that done,
████████████ gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the
soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, STICK TO THE BOAT, is your
true █████ in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM
THE BOAT, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he
should give █████████ conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving
him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped
all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, "Stick to the boat,
Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We
can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and
don't jump any more." Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that
though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which
propensity too often ██████████ with his ███████████.

But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
under very similar circumstances to the first ███████████; but this time
he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to
run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk.
Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, █████████,
blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and ██████ stretching away,
all round, to the horizon, like gold-██████'s skin hammered out to the
extremest. ███████ up and down in that sea, Pip's ████ head showed
like a head of ██████. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly
astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was
winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between
Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his
crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though
the loftiest and the █████████.

Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
████████████ is intolerable. The intense █████████████ of self in the
middle of such a heartless █████████, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark how closely they
███ their ship and only coast along her sides.

But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
oarsmen ███████████ through their own timidity, is not always manifested
by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
called, is marked with the same ████████ detestation peculiar to
military navies and armies.

But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
██████ whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
miserably. By the ██████ chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but
from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at
least, they said he was. The sea had █████████ kept his ██████ body
up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
the ████████ primal world glided to and fro before his ███████ eyes;
and the █████-merman, Wisdom, revealed his ███████ heaps; and among the
joyous, heartless, ever-████████ ██████████, Pip saw the multitudinous,
God-███████████, coral ███████, that out of the firmament of waters
heaved the colossal ████. He saw God's foot upon the ███████ of the
loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's
insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man
comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
frantic; and ████ or woe, feels then █████████████, indifferent as his
God.

For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
like abandonment befell myself.



CHAPTER ██. A ███████ of the Hand.


That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to
the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.

While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
ere going to the try-works, of which anon.

It had cooled and ████████████ to such a degree, that when, with several
others, I sat down before a large ███████████'s ████ of it, I found
it strangely █████████ into █████, here and there rolling about in the
liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid.
A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was
such a favourite cosmetic. Such a ███████! such a █████████! such a
████████! such a delicious ████████! After having my hands in it for
only a few minutes, my fingers felt like ████, and began, as it were, to
██████████ and █████████.

As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among
those soft, gentle ████████ of infiltrated ███████, woven almost within
the hour; as they ██████ broke to my fingers, and discharged all their
████████, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
██████████████ █████,--literally and truly, like the smell of spring
violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
the old ██████████ superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in ████████
the heat of anger; while ███████ in that bath, I felt ████████ free from
all ill-will, or █████████, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.

Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I ████████ that sperm
till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a
strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly
█████████ my ██-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually
squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes █████████████; as
much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
any social ██████████, or know the slightest ill-humor or ████! Come;
let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
sperm of kindness.

Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases
man must eventually lower, or at least █████, his conceit of ██████████
████████; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in
the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the ██████, the fireside, the
country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case
eternally. In thoughts of the ███████ of the night, I saw long rows of
angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.

Now, while ███████████ of sperm, it ████████ to speak of other things
akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
try-works.

First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
part of the fish, and also from the ███████ portions of his flukes. It
is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of ██████--but still contains
some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first
cut into ████████ ███████ ere going to the ██████. They look much like
blocks of █████████ marble.

Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain ███████████ parts of the
whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
often █████████████ to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
a most ██████████, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled ████, with a ██████████
snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
purple. It is █████ of ██████, in pictures of ██████. Spite of reason,
it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole
behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive
a royal ██████ from the thigh of Louis ██ ████ might have tasted,
supposing him to have been killed the first day after the ███████
season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine ███████ of the █████████ of █████████.

There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
adequately to describe. It is called ███████████; an appellation
original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
It is an █████████ oozy, ███████ affair, most frequently found in the
tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent █████████.
I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ████████ █████████ of the case,
██████████.

█████, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It ██████████ the
dark, █████████ substance which is ███████ off the back of the Greenland
or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior
souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.

███████. Strictly this word is not ██████████ to the whale's ██████████.
But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman's ██████ is
a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of
Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is
about the size of the iron part of a hoe. ████████ moved along the
oily deck, it ████████ like a leathern ████████; and by nameless
blandishments, as of magic, ███████ along with it all ██████████.

But to learn all about these █████████ matters, your best way is at once
to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.
This place has previously been mentioned as the ██████████ for the
blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper
time ███████ for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of
terror to all █████, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull
lantern, a space has been left clear for the ███████. They generally
go in pairs,--a pike-and-███████ and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is
similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name. The ████ is
something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a
sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship
pitches and ███████ about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet
itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This
spade is sharp as ████ can make it; the ████████'s feet are ████████;
the thing he stands on will sometimes ████████████ slide away from
him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his
██████████', would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among
veteran blubber-room men.



CHAPTER ██. The Cassock.


Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
post-███████████ of the whale; and had you ████████ forward nigh the
windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have ███████ with no small
curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
there, lying along lengthwise in the lee ████████. Not the wondrous
cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable ████,--longer than
a ██████████ is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black
as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or,
rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in
the secret groves of Queen ███████ in █████; and for worshipping which,
King ███, her son, did ██████ her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it
for an ███████████ at the brook ██████, as darkly set forth in the 15th
chapter of the First Book of Kings.

Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted
by two allies, heavily backs the ████████████, as the mariners call it,
and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle
deck, he now proceeds █████████████ to remove its dark ████, as an
African hunter the pelt of a ███. This done he turns the pelt inside
out, like a █████████ leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to
double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging,
to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it,
towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two █████ for arm-holes
at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer
now stands before you invested in the full ██████████ of his calling.
Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately
protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.

That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted
███████ against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into
which the ██████ pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a ████ ██████'s
desk. Arrayed in decent black; █████████ a conspicuous pulpit; intent
on bible leaves; what a candidate for an █████████████, what a lad for a
Pope were this mincer!*


*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates
to the mincer. It ███████ him to be careful, and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
boiling out the oil is much ███████████, and its quantity considerably
increased, besides perhaps █████████ it in quality.



CHAPTER ██. The Try-Works.


Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is █████████ distinguished
by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
masonry ███████ with oak and hemp in ████████████ the completed ship.
It is as if from the open field a brick-████ were transported to her
planks.

The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
█████ part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased
with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, ████████
hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
number, and each of several barrels' capacity. When not in use, they are
kept ██████████ clean. Sometimes they are polished with █████████
and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the
night-watches some ███████ old sailors will crawl into them and coil
themselves away there for a nap. While employed in █████████ them--one
man in each pot, side by side--many confidential communications
are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,
with the soapstone diligently ████████ round me, that I was first
indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in ████████ all bodies
gliding along the ███████, my soapstone for example, will descend from
any point in precisely the same time.

Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a ██████
inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
fast as it ██████████. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.

It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were
first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to ███████
the business.

"All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
works." This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his
shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a
time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick
████████ to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the
crisp, ██████████ blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains
considerable of its unctuous ██████████. These fritters feed the flames.
Like a █████████ burning ██████, or a self-consuming ███████████, once
ignited, the whale ████████ his own fuel and burns by his own body.
Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to
inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in
it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such
as may lurk in the vicinity of ████████ █████. It smells like the left
wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.

By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
carcase; sail had been made; the wind was ██████████; the wild ocean
darkness was intense. But that darkness was ██████ up by the fierce
flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty █████, and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
bold ████████, ███████, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish ████████, and
folded them in ██████████████.

The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth
in front of them. Standing on this were the █████████ shapes of the
pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's ███████. With huge ███████
poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or
stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out
of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen
heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil,
which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth
of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the
windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not
otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their
eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all
████████ with smoke and sweat, their ██████ beards, and the contrasting
barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in
the capricious ████████████ of the works. As they narrated to each other
their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth;
as their uncivilized ████████ forked upwards out of them, like the
flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers
wildly ████████████ with their huge pronged forks and ███████; as the
wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and
yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness
of the sea and the night, and ██████████ ███████ the white bone in
her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing
Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning
a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the
material counterpart of her monomaniac commander's soul.

So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,
in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the
███████████ of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before
me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred
visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable
██████████ which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.

But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
horribly conscious of something ███████ wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote
my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails,
just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I
was half conscious of putting my fingers to the ████ and mechanically
stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see
no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I
had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp ████████████ it.
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by
flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift,
rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as
rushing from all ██████ astern. A stark, ██████████ feeling, as of
death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with
the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief
sleep I had turned myself about, and was ████████ the ship's stern, with
my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just
in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very
probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this
unnatural █████████████ of the night, and the fatal contingency of being
brought by the lee!

Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; ██████ the first
hint of the ████████ tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,
the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the ███████
flames, the ████ will show in far other, at least ███████, relief; the
glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp--all others but █████!

Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
accursed ████████, nor wide ██████, nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of ██████ beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,
which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or undeveloped. With
books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the
truest of all books is Solomon's, and ████████████ is the fine hammered
steel of woe. "All is vanity." ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
of ███████████ Solomon's wisdom yet. But he who ██████ █████████ and
█████, and walks fast crossing ██████████, and would rather talk of
██████ than hell; calls Cowper, Young, ██████, ████████, poor devils all
of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime ██████ by Rabelais as
passing wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit
down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous Solomon.

But even Solomon, he says, "the man that █████████ out of the way
of understanding shall remain" (I.E., even while living) "in the
congregation of the dead." Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
██████ thee, ██████ thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a ████████
eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the ████████ gorges,
and ████ out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.
And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the
mountains; so that even in his lowest █████ the mountain eagle is still
higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.



CHAPTER ██. The Lamp.


Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's
forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
illuminated shrine of █████████ kings and ███████████. There they lay
in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.

In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
darkness to his ██████, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
███████'s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the █████████ night
the ship's black hull still houses an ████████████.

See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper ██████ at
the try-works, and ███████████ them there, as ████ of ale at a ███. He
burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to █████, █████, or ██████
contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
goes and █████ for his oil, so as to be sure of its █████████ and
███████████, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
supper of game.



CHAPTER ██. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.


Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery █████, and
slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside
and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of
old to the ████████ in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded
surtout becomes the property of his ███████████; how, in due time, he
is condemned to the pots, and, like ████████, ███████, and ████████, his
spermaceti, oil, and bone pass █████████ through the fire;--but now it
remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by
rehearsing--singing, if I may--the romantic proceeding of decanting off
his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where
once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along
beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.

While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously █████
across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX OFFICIO,
every sailor is a cooper.

At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
hatchways are ████████, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down
go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are
████████, and ████████████ closed, like a closet walled up.

In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
█████████ in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with
████████ of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of
the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as
in a ███████ yard; the smoke from the try-works has ████████ all the
bulwarks; the mariners go about ████████ with unctuousness; the entire
ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is
█████████.

But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
most ████████████ neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil █████████
a singularly █████████ virtue. This is the reason why the decks never
look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides,
from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent ███ is
readily made; and whenever any ████████████ from the back of the whale
remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly ████████████ it. Hands
go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags
███████ them to their full ████████. The soot is ███████ from the lower
rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise
faithfully ████████ and put away. The great hatch is ████████ and placed
upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of
sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined
and ████████████ industry of almost the entire ship's company, the
whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew
themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to
toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all █████, as
███████████ new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.

Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
humorously █████████ of ███████, sofas, ███████, and fine ████████;
propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to
such ██████ mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly ██████ to. Away, and
bring us napkins!

But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again
soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only step to the deck to
carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and █████, yea,
and in their very █████████ to be smoked and burned anew by the combined
fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the
heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to ███████ the
ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor
fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by
the cry of "There she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale,
and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this
is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long
████████ extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable
sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its
defilements, and learned to live here in clean ███████████ of the soul;
hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost is spouted up,
and away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life's
old ███████ again.

Oh! the ██████████████! Oh! ██████████, that in bright Greece, two
thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am, taught
thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!



CHAPTER ██. The ████████.


Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but
in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him. When he ██████ before the
binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his
purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast,
then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed
with a certain wild longing, if not ███████████.

But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to █████████ for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
worth, and the round world itself but an empty ██████, except to sell by
the ████████, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some ██████ in
the Milky Way.

Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, █████ somewhere out of the
heart of ████████ hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the
head-waters of many a ████████ flows. And though now nailed ██████ all
the █████████ of iron bolts and the █████████ of copper spikes, yet,
███████████ and immaculate to any ████████, it still preserved its Quito
glow. Nor, though placed ███████ a ruthless crew and every hour passed
by ruthless hands, and through the ████████ nights shrouded with thick
darkness which might cover any █████████ approach, nevertheless every
sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was
set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however ██████
in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners ███████ it as the white
whale's ████████. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever
live to spend it.

Now those noble golden coins of South America are as ██████ of the sun
and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, ███████, and █████████; sun's █████
and stars; █████████, horns-of-plenty, and rich ███████ waving, are in
█████████ █████████ stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to
derive an added ████████████ and █████████ glories, by passing through
those fancy █████, so █████████ poetic.

It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example
of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, █████████ DEL
███████: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;
and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning █████ that
knows no ██████. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three
Andes' ███████; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a
███████ cock; while ███████ over all was a segment of the ███████████
zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual ███████████, and the
████████ sun entering the ███████████ point at █████.

Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing.

"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-████ and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as
Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
courageous, the █████████, and ██████████ fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the ███████ globe,
which, like a ████████'s glass, to each and every man in turn but
███████ back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small █████ for those
who ask the world to █████ them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now
this ██████ sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign
of storms, the ███████! and but six months before he wheeled out of a
former equinox at █████! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in
throes, 't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be
it, then! Here's stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then."

"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's █████ must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbuck
to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. "The old man seems to read
Belshazzar's awful ███████. I have never marked the coin ████████████.
He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the ███████, in some faint
earthly symbol. So in this ████ of Death, God █████ us round; and over
all our gloom, the sun of █████████████ still ██████ a ██████ and a
hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer.
Yet, oh, the great sun is no ███████; and if, at midnight, we would fain
snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin
speaks ██████, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it,
lest Truth shake me ███████."

"There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, "he's
been ████████ it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on
Negro Hill or in ███████'s Hook, I'd not look at it very long ere
spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your
doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of ███████; with plenty of gold
████████ and ████████, and ████, and half joes, and quarter joes. What
then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing
wonderful? By ████████! let me read it once. Halloa! here's signs and
wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his ███████ calls the
zodiac, and what my ███████ below calls █████. I'll get the almanac and
as I have heard devils can be raised with ██████'s ██████████, I'll try
my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer █████████ here with
the Massachusetts calendar. Here's the book. Let's see now. Signs and
wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; ██████, or the Bull
and ██████! here's ██████ himself, or the █████. Well; the sun he
wheels among 'em. Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold
between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
the fact is, you books must know your places. You'll do to give us the
bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That's my
small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch's
█████████, and Daboll's arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if
there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There's
a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist--hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you,
Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter;
and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, ████████! To
begin: there's Aries, or the Ram--█████████ dog, he ██████ us; then,
Taurus, or the Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the
Twins--that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes
██████ the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, ███,
a roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce █████ and █████
████ with his paw; we escape, and hail █████, the Virgin! that's our
first love; we █████ and think to be happy for aye, when ███ comes
Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as ███████, or the
████████, ██████ us in the rear; we are ██████ the wound, when whang
come the arrows all round; ███████████, or the ██████, is ███████
himself. As we pluck out the ██████, stand aside! here's the
battering-ram, ███████████, or the Goat; full ████, he comes rushing,
and headlong we are tossed; when ████████, or the Water-bearer, pours
out his whole ██████ and ██████ us; and to wind up with ██████, or the
Fishes, we sleep. There's a sermon now, ████ in high heaven, and the
sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
hearty. ███████ he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
so, ████ here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly's the word for aye! Adieu,
Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the
try-works, now, and let's hear what he'll have to say. There; he's
before it; he'll out with something presently. So, so; he's beginning."

"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what's all this
staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that's true; and at
two cents the █████, that's nine hundred and sixty ██████. I won't smoke
dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's nine hundred and
sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy 'em out."

"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort
of ███████ look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman--the old
hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He
█████ up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side
of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he's
back again; what does that mean? Hark! he's muttering--voice like an old
worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!"

"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some one of these signs. I've studied signs, and know
their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old █████
in ██████████. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe
sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what's the
horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the roaring and
devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee."

"There's another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men
in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all
tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
Cannibal? As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's █████████ in the back country.
And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh--I
guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don't know what to make
of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers.
But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out
of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he
say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows
himself; there is a sun on the coin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.
Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip--poor boy! would he had died,
or I; he's half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of these
████████████--myself included--and look now, he comes to read, with that
unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!"

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Upon my soul, he's been studying ██████'s Grammar! Improving his mind,
poor fellow! But what's that he says now--hist!"

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again."

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Well, that's funny."

"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all ████; and I'm a crow,
especially when I stand a'top of this pine tree here. ███! caw! caw!
caw! caw! caw! Ain't I a crow? And where's the scare-crow? There he
stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more █████
into the sleeves of an old jacket."

"Wonder if he means me?--█████████████!--poor lad!--I could go hang
myself. Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity. I can stand
the rest, for they have plain ████; but he's too crazy-witty for my
sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering."

"Here's the ship's █████, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire
to ███████ it. But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence? Then
again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught's nailed to
the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab!
the White Whale; he'll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old
Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown
over in it; some old ██████'s wedding ring. How did it get there? And
so they'll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old
mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the
shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green
miser'll █████ ye soon! ████! hish! God goes 'mong the worlds
█████████████. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! █████! ███, hey, hey, hey,
hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!"



CHAPTER ███. Leg and Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel ███████, of London.


"Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?"

So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his
hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow. He was
a darkly-██████, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or
███████████, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in
████████ of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
behind him like the █████████ arm of a ██████'s ███████.

"Hast seen the White Whale!"

"See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head
like a ██████.

"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
him--"Stand by to lower!"

In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger.
But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the
moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
vessel at a moment's warning. Now, it is no very easy matter
for anybody--except those who are almost ██████ used to it, like
whalemen--to ███████ up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea; for
the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and
then ███████████████ drop it half way down to the kelson. So, ████████
of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
with the kindly █████████, Ahab now found himself ████████ reduced to a
clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain █████████ height
he could hardly hope to attain.

It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless ██████, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed ██████ there, and swinging towards him a
pair of ██████████-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea ██████████. But this ███████████ only lasted a minute,
because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out, "I see, I see!--avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
over the cutting-tackle."

As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved
blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This
was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his
solitary thigh into the █████ of the hook (it was like sitting in the
fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the
word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his
own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of
the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and
gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his
ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)
cried out in his walrus way, "Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones
together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm that never can shrink, d'ye
see; and a leg that never can run. Where did'st thou see the White
Whale?--how long ago?"

"The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
the East, and taking a ██████ sight along it, as if it had been a
telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."

"And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from
the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.

"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"

"████ me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"

"It was the first time in my life that I ever ███████ on the Line,"
began the Englishman. "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
███████ and milling round so, that my boat's crew could only ████ dish,
by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a ████████ great whale, with a milky-white
head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles."

"It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
breath.

"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."

"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons," cried Ahab, ██████████--"but on!"

"Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-█████████. "Well,
this old great-███████████, with the white head and hump, runs all █████
into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!

"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I
know him."

"How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not know;
but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow;
but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the
line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale's;
that went off to windward, all ███████. Seeing how matters stood, and
what a noble great whale it was--the noblest and biggest I ever saw,
sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage
he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or
the tooth it was ███████ to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's
crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped
into my first mate's boat--Mr. ████████'s here (by the way,
Captain--Mounttop; Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped
into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale
with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls
alive, man--the next instant, in a ████, I was blind as a ███--both
eyes out--all ████████ and ██████████ with black foam--the whale's tail
███████ straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
███████. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at ██████, with
a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the
second iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima
tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible █████████, I seized
hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that
like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same
instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a
flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
caught me here" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); "yes,
caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell's flames, I was
thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ████
its way along the flesh--clear along the whole length of my arm--came
out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;--and that gentleman there will tell
you the rest (by the way, captain--Dr. ██████, ship's surgeon: Bunger,
my lad,--the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."

The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the
time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his
gentlemanly ████ on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober
one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched
trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
████████████ he held in one hand, and a ████-box held in the other,
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains. But, at his superior's ████████████ of him to Ahab,
he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.

"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking my
advice, Captain ██████ here, stood our old █████--"

"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."

"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
weather there on the Line. But it was no use--I did all I could; sat up
with him nights; was very ██████ with him in the matter of diet--"

"Oh, very severe!" ██████ in the patient himself; then suddenly altering
his voice, "Drinking hot ███ ███████ with me every night, till he
couldn't see to put on the ████████; and sending me to bed, half seas
over, about three o'clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with
me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great ███████, and very
████████████ severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why
don't ye? You know you're a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead,
boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man."

"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, █████████ sir"--said the
imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--"is apt to
be facetious at times; he █████ us many ██████ things of that sort. But
I may as well say--██ ███████, as the French remark--that I myself--that
is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy--am a strict █████
██████████ man; I never drink--"

"Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits to
him; fresh water throws him into the ███████████; but go on--go on with
the arm story."

"Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly. "I was about observing,
sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that spite of my
best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the
truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more
than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line.
In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came.
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
against all rule"--pointing at it with the marlingspike--"that is the
captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one's brains
out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir"--removing his hat, and
brushing aside his hair, and ████████ a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
but which bore not the slightest ██████ trace, or any token of ever
having been a wound--"Well, the captain there will tell you how that
came here; he knows."

"No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born with
it. Oh, you solemn █████, you--you Bunger! was there ever such another
Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal."

"What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.

"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes! Well; after he sounded,
we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till
some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby
Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."

"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"

"Twice."

"But could not fasten?"

"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough? What should I do without
this other arm? And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so much as he
swallows."

"Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for ████ to
get the right. Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely and ██████████████
bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do you know, gentlemen, that the
█████████ organs of the whale are so ███████████ constructed by Divine
Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely ██████
even a man's arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the
White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means
to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by ██████. But
sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, ████████ a patient of mine
in ██████, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let
one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
or more; when I gave him an ██████, and he heaved it up in small █████,
d'ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully
incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if
you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to ████ one arm for the
sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that
case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you
shortly, that's all."

"No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to the
arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but not to
another one. No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for him once, and
that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know
that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,
he's best let alone; don't you think so, Captain?"--glancing at the
ivory leg.

"He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He's all a
magnet! How long since thou saw'st him last? Which way heading?"

"Bless my soul, and █████ the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, ██████████
walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; "this man's
blood--bring the ███████████!--it's at the boiling point!--his █████
makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a ██████ from his pocket, and
drawing near to Ahab's arm.

"Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the boat!
Which way heading?"

"Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
"What's the matter? He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain
crazy?" whispering Fedallah.

But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.

In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.



CHAPTER ███. The ████████.


Ere the English ship █████ from sight, be it set down here, that
she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes not
far behind the united royal houses of the ██████ and ████████, in point
of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our
Lord ████, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted
out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
though for some score of years previous (ever since ████) our valiant
Coffins and ██████ of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets
pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not
elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
whole globe who so harpooned him.

In 1778, a fine ship, the ██████, fitted out for the express purpose,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous ████████, boldly rounded Cape
Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the
Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English and American,
and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open.
But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again
bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons--how many, their mother only
knows--and under their immediate ████████, and partly, I think, at their
expense, the British ██████████ was induced to send the sloop-of-war
███████ on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded
by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and
did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In
████, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to
go on a ███████ cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship--well
called the "█████"--made a noble ████████████ cruise; and it was thus
that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
Nantucketer.

All honour to the █████████, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have
slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.

The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
██████ and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good ████ down in the
forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all ██████--every
soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine
gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
ivory heel--it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we ███████ it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it's
███████ off there by Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were
called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, ██████ fast in the
howling gale, a warning example to all drunken ████. However, the masts
did not go overboard; and by and by we █████████ down, so sober, that we
had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down
the forecastle scuttle, rather too much ███████ and ███████ it to my
taste.

The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it. They said it was
bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
█████████████ globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you
could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed.
If you stooped over too far forward, you ██████ their pitching out
of you like billiard-balls. The bread--but that couldn't be helped;
besides, it was an ████-█████████; in short, the bread contained the
only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it
was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all
in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the
cook's boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft,
I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty;
fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to
hat-band.

But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous, hospitable
ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing?
I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers
is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.

The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the ██████████,
██████████, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
touching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English
merchant-ship ███████ her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in
the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not ██████ and natural,
but ██████████ and particular; and, therefore, must have some special
origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.

During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I ████████ upon an
ancient Dutch volume, which, by the █████ whaling smell of it, I
knew must be about whalers. The title was, "Dan ███████," wherefore I
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
██████████ in this opinion by seeing that it was the ██████████ of one
"████ ███████████." But my friend Dr. ████████, a very learned man,
professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa █████ and
St. ████'s, to whom I handed the work for ███████████, giving him a box
of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he
█████ the book, assured me that "Dan Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper,"
but "The Merchant." In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book
treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained
a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it
was, headed, "Smeer," or "Fat," that I found a long detailed list of the
outfits for the ███████ and ███████ of ███ sail of Dutch whalemen; from
which list, as ██████████ by Dr. Snodhead, I ██████████ the following:

███,000 ███. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. ███,000 lbs. of stock
fish. ███,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,███ ███████
of butter. 20,000 lbs. █████ & Leyden cheese. ███,000 lbs. cheese
(probably an inferior article). 550 ██████ of ██████. 10,800 barrels of
████.

Most ███████████ tables are ██████████ dry in the reading; not so in
the present case, however, where the reader is ███████ with whole pipes,
barrels, ██████, and gills of good gin and good cheer.

At the time, I ███████ three days to the ████████ digesting of all
this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally █████████ to me, capable of a ██████████████ and ████████
application; and, furthermore, I ████████ supplementary tables of my
own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and
Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
naturally unctuous ███████, being ████████ still more unctuous by the
nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country
where the convivial natives pledge each other in ███████ of train oil.

The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
polar fisheries could only be ██████████ in the short summer of that
███████, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much
exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet
of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,
we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks'
allowance, █████████ of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so ███████ as one might
fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in
a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
somewhat ██████████. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But
this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer ██████ well with
the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and █████ in his
boat; and ████████ loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this ███████ the
decanter.



CHAPTER ███. A Bower in the █████████.


Hitherto, in █████████████ ████████ of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
█████ upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
upon some few interior ██████████ features. But to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to ████████ him still
further, and █████████ the points of his ████, ██████████ his ███████,
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
bones, set him before you in his █████████; that is to say, in his
unconditional skeleton.

But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver ████████
on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land
a full-grown whale on your deck for ███████████, as a cook ██████ a
roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the ███████,
ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-████████, making up the frame-work of
leviathan; and belike of the tallow-████, dairy-rooms, █████████, and
██████████ in his bowels.

I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the █████ whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
poke or bag, to make ███████ for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
contents of that young cub?

And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am ████████
to my late royal friend ███████, king of ███████, one of the Arsacides.
For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey
of ███████, I was invited to spend part of the ██████████ holidays with
the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm █████ at ███████; a sea-side
████ not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
capital.

Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
with a devout love for all matters of barbaric █████, had brought
together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could ██████; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;
and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted █████████
seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathom-deep ██████████, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a
grand temple of lordly palms now █████████ it.

The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with
Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
kept up an ██████████████ aromatic flame, so that the mystic head
again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a █████, the
terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the ████████, like the hair-hung
sword that so affrighted ████████.

It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy
Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living ███; the
███████████ earth beneath was as a ██████'s loom, with a gorgeous carpet
on it, whereof the ground-vine ████████ formed the warp and woof, and
the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden
branches; all the ██████, and █████, and ███████; the message-carrying
air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the ███████ of the
leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied
verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither
flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless
toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but one single word with
thee! Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float from forth the loom; the
freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he ██████;
and by that weaving is he ████████, that he hears no mortal voice; and
by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only
when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through
it. For even so it is in all material █████████. The spoken words that
are inaudible among the flying ████████; those same words are plainly
heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby
have ██████████ been ████████. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in
all this din of the great world's loom, thy subtlest █████████ may be
overheard afar.

Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic █████! Yet,
as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof ██████████ and ██████ around
him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven
over with the █████; every month assuming ███████, ███████ verdure; but
himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death █████████ Life; the grim
god █████ with ████████ Life, and begat him █████-headed glories.

Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as
an object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through the
ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, ████████, ██████ long amid
its many winding, shaded colonnades and ███████. But soon my line was
out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.
I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.

Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.
From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the
altitude of the final rib, "How now!" they shouted; "███'st thou measure
this our god! That's for us." "Aye, priests--well, how long do ye make
him, then?" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning
feet and inches; they cracked each other's ███████ with their
yard-sticks--the great skull ██████--and seizing that lucky chance, I
quickly concluded my own ██████████████.

These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be
it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can
refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic ██████, they tell
me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I
have heard that in the museum of ██████████, in New Hampshire, they have
what the proprietors call "the only perfect specimen of a Greenland or
River Whale in the United States." Moreover, at a place in █████████,
England, ██████ █████████ by name, a certain Sir ████████ Constable has
in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size,
by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.

In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two █████████
belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
Clifford, because he was lord of the ██████████ of those parts. Sir
Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a
great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
████████--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day
upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
████████; and a ███████ will show round future visitors with a bunch of
████ at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of ████████ ████████ for a peep at
the whispering gallery in the spinal column; ██████████ to hear the echo
in the hollow of his cerebellum; and ████████ for the unrivalled view
from his forehead.

The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
████████ from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
██████████ at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable ██████████. But as I was crowded for space, and ██████
the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was
then composing--at least, what ██████████ parts might remain--I did not
trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
enter into a congenial █████████████ of the whale.



CHAPTER ███. Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.


In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we
are ███████ to ███████. Such a statement may prove useful here.

According to a careful ███████████ I have made, and which I partly base
upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest
sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably ████████ the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants.

Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination?

Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in
this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your
arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the
general structure we are about to view.

In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,
his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of
plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a
third of its length, was the mighty circular ██████ of ribs which once
████████ his ██████.

To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty
of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the
time, but a long, ████████████ timber.

The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,
was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
████████████ longer, till you came to the ██████ of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
███████ five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore
a ██████ ██████████████ to their length. The middle ribs were the most
arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
████████ bridges over small streams.

In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of
the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish
which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the
invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the
living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw
but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of
added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the
ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the
weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!

How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
██████████ skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the
heart of ████████ perils; only when within the ████████ of his █████
flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale
be truly and livingly found out.

But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
it's done, it looks much like ██████'s Pillar.

There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
not locked together. They mostly lie like the great ███████ blocks on
a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,
a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
had been lost by some little cannibal ███████, the priest's children,
who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple
child's play.



CHAPTER ███. The ██████ Whale.


From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial █████ whereon
to enlarge, ███████, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
████████ him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail,
and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
███████████ of his ██████████, where they lie in him like great
cables and ███████ coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
line-of-battle-ship.

Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me
to ███████ myself ████████████ ██████████ in the enterprise; not
overlooking the minutest ███████ █████ of his blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him
in most of his present ██████████ and anatomical peculiarities, it
now remains to ███████ him in an ██████████████, █████████████, and
antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
Leviathan--to an ant or a ████--such portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably █████████████. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is
altered. Fain am I to stagger to this ███████ under the ██████████
words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
convenient to ███████ one in the course of these █████████████, I have
invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, █████████ purchased
for that purpose; because that famous █████████████'s uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to ███████ a lexicon to be used by a whale author
like me.

One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing
of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my ███████████ expands into ███████
capitals. Give me a ██████'s quill! Give me ████████' crater for an
████████! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of ███████ my
thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
███████████ comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
█████████, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving █████████
of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not █████████ its
███████. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal
theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose
a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the
flea, though many there be who have tried it.

Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials
as a █████████, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been
a stone-mason, and also a great ██████ of ███████, canals and █████,
wine-vaults, cellars, and ████████ of all sorts. Likewise, by way of
preliminary, I desire to ██████ the reader, that while in the earlier
geological strata there are found the ███████ of monsters now almost
completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
the ████████ ██████████ seem the connecting, or at any rate ███████████
links, between the █████████████ creatures, and those whose remote
posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales
hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last
preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to ███████ their taking
rank as Cetacean fossils.

Detached broken fossils of pre-███████ whales, fragments of their bones
and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been
found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in
████████, and in the States of █████████, Mississippi, and Alabama.
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
year ████ was ███████████ in the ███ ████████ in █████, a short street
opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones
disinterred in excavating the great docks of ███████, in Napoleon's
time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly
unknown Leviathanic species.

But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year ████, on
the plantation of Judge ██████, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous
slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen
angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed
upon it the name of ████████████. But some specimen bones of it being
taken across the sea to Owen, the English █████████, it turned out
that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A
significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this
book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the
shape of his fully invested body. So Owen ████████████ the monster
█████████; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society,
pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures
which the █████████ of the globe have ███████ out of existence.

When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all █████████████ by ███████ ████████████ to
the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
the other hand similar ██████████ to the annihilated antichronical
Leviathans, their incalculable ███████; I am, by a flood, borne back
to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;
for time began with man. Here ██████'s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged
████████ of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in
all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an ███████████
hand's breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the
whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines
of the Andes and the █████████. Who can show a ████████ like Leviathan?
Ahab's harpoon had shed █████ blood than the ███████'s. ██████████ seems
a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with ████. I am horror-struck
at this ██████████, █████████ existence of the unspeakable terrors of
the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after
all humane ages are over.

But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
██████████ plates of nature, and in █████████ and ████ ██████████ his
ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
█████ of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of ████████,
some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted ███████████, abounding in centaurs, ████████, and
dolphins, similar to the █████████ figures on the celestial globe of the
███████. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there
swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was ███████.

Nor must there be omitted another strange ███████████ of the antiquity
of the whale, in his own ███████ post-████████ reality, as set down by
the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that
by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can pass it
without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either
side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea,
and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em. They keep a Whale's Rib
of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with
its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be
reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said
to have ████ there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians
██████, that a Prophet who prophesy'd of ███████, came from this Temple,
and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth
by the Whale at the Base of the Temple."

In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.



CHAPTER ███. Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?


Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly ████████, whether,
in the long course of his generations, he has not ███████████ from the
original bulk of his sires.

But upon █████████████ we find, that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
ones.

Of all the pre-adamite whales yet ███████, by far the largest is the
Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
that the ████-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large
sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that
Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of
capture.

But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?

█████████, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny
tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and ███████████
of others which measured eight hundred feet in length--Rope Walks and
Thames ███████ of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander,
█████'s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the ███████ of Sciences
setting down certain Iceland Whales (██████-██████, or Wrinkled Bellies)
at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet.
And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales,
in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at
one hundred ██████, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work
was published so late as A.D. 1825.

But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is
as big as his █████████ in Pliny's time. And if ever I go where Pliny
is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies
that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian
and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are
drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, █████-fed, prize cattle
of ██████████, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the ███████
of Pharaoh's fat ████; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of
all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.

But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost ██████████ look-outs
at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now ███████████ even through
Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers
of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure
so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last
be ████████████ from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man,
smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.

Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
which, not forty years ago, ██████████ by tens of thousands the prairies
of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron █████ and ███████ with
their thunder-clotted brows upon the █████ of populous river-capitals,
where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that
the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy ██████████.

But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in Illinois
exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
cause of this wondrous █████████████ was the spear of man; yet the far
different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily ███████ so inglorious an
end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God,
if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days
of the old ████████ and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when
the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and
a virgin, the same number of ██████████ men, for the same number of
months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
were, could be █████████████ stated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
███████ extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years
(the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
████████████. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
██████████ by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, █████, and
pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally ██████████ seems
the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer
█████ many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that
species also is █████████. For they are only being driven from
promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with
their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very
recently startled by the ██████████ spectacle.

Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
impregnable. And as upon the ████████ of their valleys, the frosty █████
have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the ████████ and
glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to
their Polar ████████, and diving under the ultimate glassy ████████ and
walls there, come up among icy fields and █████; and in a charmed circle
of everlasting December, bid ████████ to all pursuit from man.

But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
13,000, have been ████████ slain on the nor'-west coast by the Americans
alone; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.

Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the ████████████
of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
█████, the historian of ███, when he tells us that at one hunting the
King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
numerous as ██████ of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no
reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for
thousands of years, by █████████, by Porus, by ████████, and by all the
successive monarchs of the East--if they still ███████ there in great
numbers, much more may the great whale ███████ all hunting, since he
has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all
Asia, both ████████, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles
of the sea combined.

Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great █████████
of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea
of, by █████████ all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children
who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to
the present human population of the globe.

Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
species, however ██████████ in his individuality. He swam the seas
before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the ███████. In Noah's flood he
████████ Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
the ███████████, to kill off its ████, then the eternal whale will still
survive, and rearing upon the topmost █████ of the equatorial flood,
spout his ███████ defiance to the skies.



CHAPTER ███. Ahab's Leg.


The █████████████ manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a ██████ of his
boat that his ivory leg had received a half-███████████ shock. And
when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
vehemently wheeled round with an ██████ command to the steersman (it
was, as ever, something about his not steering ██████████ enough); then,
the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and ██████,
that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances █████, yet
Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.

And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket, that he
had been found one night lying █████ upon the ground, and ██████████;
by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
ivory limb having been so violently █████████, that it had stake-wise
smitten, and all but pierced his █████; nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely █████.

Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous
reptile of the █████ ███████████ his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
████████ of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable
events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought
Ahab; since both the ████████ and posterity of Grief go further than the
ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is
an inference from certain ███████ teachings, that while some natural
██████████ here shall have no children born to them for the other world,
but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-█████████████ of
all hell's despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still
█████████ beget to themselves an eternally ███████████ progeny of griefs
beyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an
██████████ in the deeper ████████ of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while
even the highest earthly ██████████ ever have a certain ████████████
█████████ lurking in them, but, at bottom, all █████████, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an ███████████ grandeur; so do their
diligent ████████-out not belie the obvious █████████. To trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the
██████████ ██████████████ of the gods; so that, in the face of all the
glad, hay-making suns, and soft ██████████, round harvest-█████, we must
needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad.
The ████████████, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of
sorrow in the ███████.

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing
of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-████-like
█████████████; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as
it were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg's bruited
reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed,
as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every ██████████ ███████ more of
significant darkness than of ███████████ light. But, in the end, it all
came out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at
the bottom of his temporary ███████████. And not only this, but to that
ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed
the privilege of a less ██████ approach to him; to that timid circle the
above hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, ███████ ███████████ for by
Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely █████████ from the land
of spirits and of █████. So that, through their zeal for him, they had
all █████████, so far as in them lay, to ██████ up the knowledge of
this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable
interval had elapsed, did it █████████ upon the Pequod's decks.

But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous █████ in the air,
or the vindictive princes and ██████████ of fire, have to do or not
with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain
practical ██████████;--he called the carpenter.

And when that ███████████ appeared before him, he bade him without delay
set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied
with all the █████ and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus
far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection
of the stoutest, ████████-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the
carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to
provide all the ████████ for it, independent of those pertaining to
the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship's █████ was ordered to be
hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate
the affair, the ██████████ was commanded to proceed at once to the
███████ of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.



CHAPTER ███. The Carpenter.


Seat thyself ████████████ among the moons of Saturn, and take high
██████████ man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
seem a mob of unnecessary ██████████, both contemporary and hereditary.
But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
the high, humane ███████████; the Pequod's carpenter was no duplicate;
hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
alike experienced in numerous trades and ████████ collateral to his own;
the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and ████████████ trunk of all
those numerous ███████████ which more or less have to do with wood as an
auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the generic
remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly █████████ in
those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
in a large ship, upon a three or four years' voyage, in uncivilized
and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary
duties:--█████████ stove boats, sprung spars, █████████ the shape of
clumsy-██████ oars, inserting bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails
in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly
pertaining to his special business; he was moreover ██████████████
██████ in all manner of ███████████ █████████, both useful and
capricious.

The one grand stage where he ███████ all his various parts so manifold,
was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
vices, of different █████, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
████████████ against the rear of the Try-works.

A ████████ pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway
files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage ██████ on board,
and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and
cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking
cage for it. An oarsman ███████ his wrist: the carpenter ████████ a
soothing ██████. Stubb ██████ for ██████████ stars to be painted upon
the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes
a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter ██████ his ears.
Another has the toothache: the carpenter out ███████, and clapping
one hand upon his bench ████ him be seated there; but the poor fellow
████████████ ██████ under the ███████████ operation; whirling round the
handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in
that, if he would have him draw the tooth.

Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for ████████. But
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such
liveliness of ██████████ in him, too; all this would seem to argue some
uncommon ████████ of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was
this man more remarkable, than for a certain ██████████ █████████ as
it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding
infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity
discernible in the whole visible world; which while ███████████ active
in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ███████ you,
though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible
stolidity in him, █████████, too, as it appeared, an all-█████████
█████████████;--yet was it █████ dashed at times, with an old,
crutch-like, antediluvian, ████████ humorousness, not ██████████ now
and then with a certain grizzled █████████; such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of Noah's ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
████████, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss;
but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward █████████
might have originally █████████ to him? He was a stript ████████; an
████████████ integral; uncompromised as a new-born ████; living without
████████████ reference to this world or the next. You might almost
say, that this strange █████████████████ in him involved a sort of
██████████████; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so
much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to
it, or by any ████████████ of all these, even or ██████; but merely by
a kind of deaf and dumb, ███████████ ███████ process. He was a pure
███████████; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early
█████ along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of
those unreasoning but still highly useful, ██████ IN █████, █████████
contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little swelled--of a
common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,
but also screw-███████, cork-██████, ████████, ████, pens, ██████,
nail-██████, ██████████████. So, if his █████████ wanted to use the
carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part
of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the
legs, and there they were.

Yet, as previously hinted, this ██████████, open-and-shut carpenter,
was, after all, no mere ███████ of an █████████. If he did not have a
common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its duty. What that was, whether essence of ███████████, or a few
drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it
had ██████ for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
him a great part of the time █████████████; but only like an unreasoning
wheel, which also █████████ ████████████; or rather, his body was a
sentry-box and this ████████████ on guard there, and talking all the
time to keep himself awake.



CHAPTER ███. Ahab and the Carpenter.

The Deck--First Night Watch.


(CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE-BENCH, AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO
LANTERNS BUSILY ██████ THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG, WHICH JOIST IS
FIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE. SLABS OF IVORY, LEATHER STRAPS, PADS, SCREWS,
AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH. FORWARD, THE RED
FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN, WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORK.)


████ the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,
and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
shinbones. Let's try another. Aye, now, this works better (███████).
Halloa, this bone dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's (SNEEZES)--yes it's
(SNEEZES)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak! This is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and
you don't get this dust; ████████ a live bone, and you don't get it
(SNEEZES). Come, come, you old ████, there, bear a hand, and let's have
that ferule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready for them presently. Lucky
now (SNEEZES) there's no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little;
but a mere ████████--why it's easy as making hop-poles; only I should
like to put a good ██████ on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I
could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady
in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in ████
windows wouldn't compare at all. They ████ water, they do; and of
course get rheumatic, and have to be ████████ (SNEEZES) with washes and
███████, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must
call his old █████████, and see whether the length will be all right;
too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that's the heel; we are in luck;
here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.

AHAB (ADVANCING)

(DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES ████████ AT TIMES)


Well, ████████!

Just in time, sir. If the captain ███████, I will now mark the length.
Let me measure, sir.

Measured for a leg! good. Well, it's not the first time. About it!
There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
carpenter; let me feel its ████ once. So, so; it does █████ some.

Oh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!

No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold, man. What's Prometheus about there?--the
blacksmith, I mean--what's he about?

He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.

Right. It's a ███████████; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
fierce red flame there!

Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

██-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that
old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made in fire must
properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable. How the soot flies!
This must be the remainder the Greek made the ████████ of. Carpenter,
when he's through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
shoulder-blades; there's a ██████ aboard with a ████████ pack.

Sir?

Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a
desirable ███████. ████████, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
████████ after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em, to stay
in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,
brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let
me see--shall I order eyes to see ████████? No, but put a sky-light on
top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.

Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should like
to know? Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).

'Tis but indifferent ████████████ to make a blind dome; here's one. No,
no, no; I must have a lantern.

Ho, ho! That's it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

What art thou thrusting that █████-███████ into my face for, man?
████████ light is worse than presented pistols.

I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.


Carpenter? why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say,
an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,
carpenter;--or would'st thou rather work in clay?

Sir?--Clay? clay, sir? That's ███; we leave clay to ████████, sir.

The fellow's impious! What art thou sneezing about?

Bone is rather dusty, sir.

Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
living people's noses.

Sir?--oh! ah!--I guess so;--yes--dear!

Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou ███████ thyself a right good
workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well
for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst
thou not drive that old Adam away?

Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
pricking him at times. May I ██████ ask if it be really so, sir?

It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
soul. Where thou ███████ tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a
hair, do I. Is't a ██████?

I should humbly call it a █████, sir.

Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
may not be invisibly and ████████████████████ standing precisely where
thou now ████████; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear █████████████? Hold, don't
speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now
so long █████████; then, why █████ not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery
pains of hell for ever, and without a body? ███!

Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again;
I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.

Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before the
leg is done?

Perhaps an hour, sir.

██████ away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO). Oh, Life! Here
I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing ██████ to this █████████ for
a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal █████-████████████ which will
not do away with ███████. I would be free as air; and I'm down in the
whole world's books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with
the ██████████ ███████████ at the ███████ of the Roman empire (which was
the world's); and yet I ███ for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
heavens! I'll get a ████████, and into it, and ████████ myself down to
one small, ███████████ vertebra. So.

CARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).


Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he's
queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps ███████ it into
Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very queer. And
here's his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here's his bedfellow! has
a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he'll stand
on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and
all three places standing in one hell--how was that? Oh! I don't wonder
he looked so scornful at me! I'm a sort of strange-█████████ sometimes,
they say; but that's only █████████-like. Then, a short, little old body
like me, should never █████████ to wade out into deep waters with tall,
█████-built captains; the water ██████ you under the chin pretty quick,
and there's a great cry for life-boats. And here's the heron's leg!
long and ████, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs █████
a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a
tender-hearted old lady uses her ████-████ old coach-horses. But Ahab;
oh he's a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and ████████ the
other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there,
you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and let's finish it
before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for
all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round ██████████ old beer
barrels, to fill 'em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real
live leg, filed down to nothing but the ████; he'll be standing on this
to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the
little ████ █████, ████████ ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So,
so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!



CHAPTER ███. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.


According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into
the cabin to report this ████████████ affair.*


*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular ██████████ duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and ██████
the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is
removed by the ship's pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept
██████ tight; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the
mariners readily detect any serious ███████ in the precious cargo.


Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to ███████ and
the ██████ Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with
a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
Japanese islands--██████, ███████, and ██████. With his snow-white new
ivory leg ██████ against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
███████-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with his
back to the gangway door, was █████████ his brow, and tracing his old
courses again.

"Who's there?" hearing the ████████ at the door, but not turning round
to it. "On deck! Begone!"

"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We
must up ███████ and break out."

"Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are ███████ Japan; heave-to here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"

"Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth ██████,
sir."

"So it is, so it is; if we get it."

"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."

"And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!
I'm all █████ myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,
but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a far worse plight
than the Pequod's, man. Yet I don't stop to plug my leak; for who can
find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if
found, in this life's howling gale? Starbuck! I'll not have the Burtons
hoisted."

"What will the owners say, sir?"

"Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and ███████ the Typhoons. What
cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always ███████ to me, Starbuck,
about those ███████ owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But
look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On deck!"

"Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward █████████████
of itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself;
"A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
enough ██████ in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab."

"Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to ██████████ think of me?--On
deck!"

"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir--to be ██████████!
Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?"

Ahab seized a loaded ██████ from the rack (forming part of most
South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"

For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
the levelled tube. But, █████████ his emotion, he half calmly rose,
and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: "Thou hast
████████, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of
Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of
thyself, old man."

"He █████ brave, but nevertheless █████; most careful bravery that!"
murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. "What's that he said--Ahab
beware of Ahab--there's something there!" Then unconsciously using the
musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
cabin; but presently the thick ██████ of his forehead relaxed, and
returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.

"Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the mate;
then raising his voice to the crew: "████ the t'gallant-sails, and
close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
and break out in the main-hold."

It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of ███████ in him;
or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, ███████████
forbade the slightest symptom of open ████████████, however transient,
in the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders
were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.



CHAPTER ███. Queequeg in His Coffin.


Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic █████ into the daylight above. So deep did they
go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the █████████
█████████, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask
containing coins of Captain Noah, with ██████ of the posted ████████,
vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after
tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and ██████ of staves, and
iron ███████ of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks
were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if
you were ████████ over empty █████████, and reeled and rolled in the sea
like an air-freighted ████████. Top-heavy was the ship as a ██████████
student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons
did not visit them then.

Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan █████████, and fast
bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
to his endless end.

Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, █████████ are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but--as
we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
█████████ casks and see to their ███████. To be short, among whalemen,
the harpooneers are the ███████, so called.

Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half █████████████, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that ████████ and slime, like a green spotted ██████ at the bottom
of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
caught a terrible █████ which ██████ into a fever; and at last, after
some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
frame and tattooing. But as all else in him ███████, and his cheek-bones
grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing ██████ and fuller;
they became of a strange ████████ of lustre; and mildly but deeply
looked out at you there from his ████████, a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like
circles on the water, which, as they grow ███████, expand; so his eyes
seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who
were ██████████ when █████████ died. For whatever is truly wondrous and
fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing
near of Death, which alike levels all, alike █████████ all with a last
revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.
So that--let us say it again--no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and
██████ thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping
over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying
hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final
rest, and the ocean's invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher
towards his destined heaven.

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he
had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not
unlike the custom of his own race, who, after █████████ a dead warrior,
stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to
the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars
are isles, but that far beyond all visible ████████, their own mild,
█████████████ seas, █████████ with the blue heavens; and so form the
white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at
the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial
to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
much lee-way █████ the dim ages.

Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might
include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
groves of the ████████ islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of
the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
███████████ of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly ████████ Queequeg's
person as he shifted the rule.

"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ██████████ the Long Island
sailor.

Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference, now ██████████████ measured on it the exact length the coffin
was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches
at its ███████████. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools,
and to work.

When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,
he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

███████████ the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one's
consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
dying men are the most ██████████; and certainly, since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
indulged.

Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with
an █████████ eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,
biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water
was placed at the head, and a small bag of █████ earth scraped up in
the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a
pillow, Queequeg now █████████ to be lifted into his final bed, that he
might make trial of its ████████, if any it had. He lay without moving
a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little
god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he
called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.
The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg
in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view. "██████"
(it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced
in his hammock.

But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft ████████, took him
by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.

"Poor █████! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet ████████ where
the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who's now been missing long: I think
he's in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he
must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;--I found
it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I'll beat ye your dying
march."

"I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in
violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient ███████;
and that when the mystery is ██████, it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip,
in this strange █████████ of his lunacy, brings heavenly ████████ of all
our heavenly █████. Where learned he that, but there?--Hark! he speaks
again: but more wildly now."

"Form two and two! Let's make a General of him! Ho, where's his harpoon?
Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!--mind ye that;
Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
a'shiver;--out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles
he's a ███████; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped from
a whale-boat! I'd never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! █████ upon all
███████--shame upon them! Let 'em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a
whale-boat. Shame! shame!"

During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and █████████, when some
expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
cause of his sudden █████████████ was this;--at a critical moment, he
had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of
his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word,
it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere
sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some
violent, ████████████, unintelligent █████████ of that sort.

Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
that while a sick, civilized man may be six months ████████████,
generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
pronounced himself fit for a fight.

With a wild ██████████, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
████████ into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and
seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on
his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical
treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own
proper person was a riddle to ██████; a wondrous work in one volume; but
whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart
beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore destined in
the end to ███████ away with the living parchment whereon they were
█████████, and so be ████████ to the last. And this thought it must
have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when
one morning turning away from █████████ poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish
█████████████ of the gods!"



CHAPTER ███. The Pacific.


When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific
with uncounted thanks, for now the long ████████████ of my youth was
answered; that serene ocean rolled █████████ from me a thousand leagues
of blue.

There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
awful █████████ seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
fabled undulations of the ████████ ███ over the buried Evangelist St.
John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
prairies and ███████' Fields of all four continents, the waves should
rise and fall, and ███ and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed
shades and shadows, drowned dreams, █████████████, reveries; all that
we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like
██████████ in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their
████████████.

To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
ever after be the sea of his ████████. It rolls the ███████ waters of
the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
waves wash the moles of the new-built ███████████ towns, but yesterday
planted by the █████████ race of men, and ████ the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
Archipelagoes, and impenetrable ██████. Thus this mysterious, divine
Pacific zones the world's whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay
to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.

But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the ██████ musk from the Bashee isles
(in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
███████████ inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
cruising-ground, the old man's purpose intensified itself. His firm lips
met like the lips of a vice; the █████ of his forehead's veins swelled
like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through
the vaulted hull, "Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!"



CHAPTER ███. The Blacksmith.


████████ himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated, █████, the begrimed, █████████ old
blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
concluding his ████████████ work for Ahab's leg, but still retained
it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and ███████ to do
some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads,
harpoons, and lances, and █████████ watching his every sooty movement,
as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded
by a patient arm. No ██████, no impatience, no petulance did come from
him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his ███████████
broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the
heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it
was.--Most miserable!

A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
██████ in his ████, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
curiosity of the mariners. And to the ███████████ of their persisted
████████████ he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.

███████, and not ██████████, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road
running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-████████ felt
the deadly ████████ stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet ███████████████ fifth
act of the grief of his life's █████.

He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had ███████████
encountered that thing in sorrow's ██████████ called ruin. He had been
an ███████ of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
██████, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further
concealed in a most cunning ████████████, a desperate burglar slid into
his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
his family's heart. It was the Bottle ████████! Upon the opening of that
fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for
prudent, most wise, and ████████ reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in
the ████████ of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
that always had the young and loving healthy wife ████████ with no
███████ nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of
her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose ██████████████, muffled by
passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not █████████,
in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron ███████, the blacksmith's
infants were rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? █████
thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon
him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a
truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and
all of them a care-killing ██████████. But Death plucked down some
████████ █████ brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the
████████████████ of some other family, and left the worse than useless
old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to
harvest.

Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last;
the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, ████████████
gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the ███████ fell; the
forge choked up with ███████; the house was sold; the mother dived
down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her
thither; and the █████████, ██████████ old man staggered off a vagabond
in █████; his every woe ████████████; his grey head a scorn to flaxen
█████!

Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
is only a launching into the region of the strange ███████; it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
such men, who still have left in them some interior ████████████ against
███████, does the all-███████████ and all-█████████ ocean ██████████
spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and
wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite
Pacifics, the thousand ████████ sing to them--"Come hither,
broken-hearted; here is another life without the █████ of intermediate
death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come
hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
█████████, landed world, is more █████████ than death. Come hither! put
up THY ██████████, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we
marry thee!"

██████████ to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall
of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went
a-whaling.



CHAPTER ███. The Forge.


With matted beard, and ███████ in a █████████ shark-skin █████, about
mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab came
along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began █████████ it upon the
anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
some of which flew close to Ahab.

"Are these thy Mother █████'s ████████, Perth? they are always flying
in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here, they
burn; but thou--thou ███'st among them without a ██████."

"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth, resting
for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily can'st thou
scorch a scar."

"Well, well; no more. Thy ██████ voice sounds too calmly, sanely ██████
to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
that is not mad. Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
not go mad? How can'st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet
hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What ████ thou making there?"

"███████ an old pike-head, sir; there were █████ and dents in it."

"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
usage as it had?"

"I think so, sir."

"And I suppose thou can'st ███████ almost any seams and dents; never
mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"

"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."

"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, ████████████ advancing, and leaning
with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye
smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across his
ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay
my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
Answer! Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"

"Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?"

"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is ████████████; for
though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the
bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles! But, away with child's play; no
more █████ and pikes to-day. Look ye here!" jingling the leathern bag,
as if it were full of gold coins. "I, too, want a harpoon made; one that
a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will
stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There's the stuff," flinging
the pouch upon the anvil. "Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered
nail-██████ of the steel shoes of ██████ horses."

"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the
best and ███████████ stuff we blacksmiths ever work."

"I know it, old man; these stubbs will ████ together like ████ from the
melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
first, twelve rods for its █████; then wind, and twist, and hammer these
twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll
blow the fire."

When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. "A
████!" rejecting the last one. "Work that over again, Perth."

This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,
with regular, gasping ████, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to
him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
some ████████ on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.

"What's that bunch of ████████ dodging about there for?" muttered Stubb,
looking on from the forecastle. "That Parsee smells fire like a █████;
and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."

At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
Perth, to ██████ it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.

"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" ███████ for a moment with the ████;
"have I been but forging my own ████████-iron, then?"

"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
harpoon for the White Whale?"

"For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them
thyself, man. Here are my ██████--the best of steel; here, and make the
barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."

For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
not use them.

"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither █████, ███,
nor pray till--but here--to work!"

Fashioned at last into an ██████ shape, and welded by Perth to the
shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith
was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to █████████ them, he
cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.

"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of
dark nods replied, Yes. Three █████████ were made in the heathen flesh,
and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.

"███ non ███████ ██ in ██████ ██████, ███ in nomine ███████!"
deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron ███████████ devoured the
█████████ blood.

Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of ███████,
with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of
the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then ███████, and some fathoms of
it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. ████████
his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a ████-string, then eagerly
bending over it, and seeing no ██████████, Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and
now for the seizings."

At one extremity the rope was ██████████, and the separate spread yarns
were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured so, with
██████████████ of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three
Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the
weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,
both ████████ ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,
light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange
█████████ not ███████████ blended with the black tragedy of the
melancholy ship, and ██████ it!



CHAPTER ███. The ██████.


Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the
stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing,
or ████████ after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy
minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success
for their pains.

At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a █████ canoe; and so
sociably ██████ with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
████ they ████ against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean's skin, one ███████ the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but ████████ a
remorseless ████.

These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain ██████, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears, while their
hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.

The long-drawn virgin █████; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this █████ with your most
mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, ██████████████,
and form one ████████ whole.

Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem
to open in him his own secret golden ██████████, yet did his breath upon
them prove but ██████████.

Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless ██████████ in the soul; in
ye,--though long ███████ by the dead drought of the ██████ life,--in ye,
men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning ██████; and for some
few fleeting moments, feel the cool ███ of the life immortal on them.
Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
storm for every calm. There is no steady ███████████ progress in this
life; we do not advance through fixed ██████████, and at the last one
pause:--through infancy's unconscious spell, ███████'s ███████████
faith, ███████████' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
█████████, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once
gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men,
and ███ eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we ██████ no
more? In what rapt █████ sails the world, of which the ████████ will
never weary? Where is the █████████'s father hidden? Our souls are like
those orphans whose ████████ mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
our █████████ lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.

And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that
same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--

"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever █████ saw in his young bride's
eye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-██████ sharks, and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways. Let faith ████ fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep
down and do believe."

And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
golden light:--

"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that
he has always been jolly!"



CHAPTER ███. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.


And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.

It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad
holiday ███████, was joyously, though somewhat vain-██████████, sailing
round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to
pointing her prow for home.

The three men at her mast-head wore long █████████ of narrow red ███████
at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;
and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours
were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of
her three ████████ tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her
top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious
fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a ██████ lamp.

As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same
seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a
single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to
make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental
casks had been ████████ for, from the ships she had met; and these were
stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms.
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into ████████-wood; and the
cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the
floor for a ███████████. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually
███████ and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously
added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and
filled it; that the steward had ███████ his spare coffee-pot and filled
it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and
filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the
captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands
into, in self-██████████ testimony of his entire satisfaction.

As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
█████████ sound of enormous █████ came from her forecastle; and drawing
still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach skin of
the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were
dancing with the olive-████ girls who had ██████ with them from the
Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island ███████, with
glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious
jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at
the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been
removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed
████████, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and
mortar were being hurled into the sea.

Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's
wakes--one all ███████████ for things passed, the other all ███████████
as to things to come--their two captains in themselves ████████████ the
whole striking contrast of the scene.

"Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander, lifting
a glass and a bottle in the air.

"Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.

"No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the other
good-humoredly. "Come aboard!"

"Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?"

"Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,
old hearty, come along. I'll soon take that black from your brow. Come
along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound."

"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then █████, "Thou art
a full ship and homeward bound, thou █████; well, then, call me an empty
ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there!
Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"

And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the ████████
Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the lively
revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the
█████████████ craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and
then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two
remote associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket
soundings.



CHAPTER ███. The Dying Whale.


Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's ██████████
sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed
it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,
whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.

It was far down the afternoon; and when all the █████████ of the crimson
fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun
and whale both ██████ died together; then, such a sweetness and such
█████████████, such ███████████ ███████ curled up in that rosy air, that
it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green ███████ valleys of
the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, ████████ turned sailor, had
gone to sea, freighted with these ██████ █████.

Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had ███████
off from the whale, sat intently watching his final ███████ from the now
tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
dying--the turning ████████ of the head, and so expiring--that strange
spectacle, beheld of such a ██████ evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a
████████████ unknown before.

"He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial ██████ of the sun!--Oh
that these too-█████████ eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe;
in these most ██████ and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
rolled on speechless and ████████ to, as stars that shine upon the
█████'s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but
see! no sooner dead, than death ██████ round the corpse, and it heads
some other way.

"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these ██████████ seas;
thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly ████████ to me in the
wide-████████████ Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
again, without a lesson to me.

"Oh, ██████ ██████ and welded hip of power! Oh, high ████████, █████████
jet!--that one ████████, this one ███████ all in vain! In vain, oh
whale, dost thou seek ████████████ with yon all-quickening sun, that
only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker
half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy █████████
███████████ float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living
things, exhaled as air, but water now.

"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet ███████ by the sea; though
hill and valley ████████ me, ye billows are my ██████-brothers!"



CHAPTER ███. The Whale Watch.


The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.

The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled ██████████ glare
upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
gently ██████ the whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.

Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that ██████████ played round the
whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound
like the ███████ in █████████ over ███████████ of ██████████ ghosts of
Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.

Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world. "I have dreamed it again," said he.

"Of the ███████? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?"

"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"

"But I said, old man, that ere thou ███████ die on this voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
America."

"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its ██████
floating over the ocean with the waves for the ████-bearers. Ha! Such a
sight we shall not soon see."

"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."

"And what was that saying about thyself?"

"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."

"And when thou art so gone before--if that ever ██████--then ere I can
follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it not
so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
███████ that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."

"Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."

"The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea," cried
Ahab, with a laugh of ████████;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"

Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship.



CHAPTER ███. The ████████.


The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship's
prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high
noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to █████████ his
latitude.

Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences. That ████████████ vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
█████ of the glassy ocean's ████████████ burning-glass. The sky looks
lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness
of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable █████████ of God's throne.
Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through
which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form
to the roll of the ship, and with his ████████████-looking instrument
placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian.
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling
beneath him on the ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's,
was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded
their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly ███████████████.
At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon
his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that
precise instant. Then falling into a moment's ██████, he again looked up
towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high and
mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou cast the
least hint where I SHALL be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing
besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou
must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is
even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally
beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!"

Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
numerous ████████████ contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
"Foolish ███! babies' █████████ of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and
Captains; the world █████ of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what
after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou
thyself █████████ to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds
thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of water
or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy █████████
thou █████████ the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed
be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live
█████████ but ████████ him, as these old eyes are even now scorched
with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth's horizon are the
glances of man's eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if God
had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!"
dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I █████ my earthly way by thee;
the level ship's compass, and the level █████████████, by log and by
line; THESE shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,"
lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I ███████ on thee, thou paltry
thing that ██████ ████████ on high; thus I split and destroy thee!"

As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus ████████ with his live
and dead feet, a ████████ triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
██████████ despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over
the mute, motionless Parsee's face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
while, █████████ by the aspect of their commander, the seamen █████████
together on the forecastle, till Ahab, ██████████ pacing the deck,
shouted out--"To the braces! Up helm!--square in!"

In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts ███████ poised upon
her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three ███████ ███████████ on one
sufficient steed.

Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's
tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went ████████ along the deck.

"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of
its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down,
to ███████ dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine,
what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!"

"Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.
Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common ████████. Well, well; I heard Ahab
mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine;
swears that I must play them, and no others.' And damn me, Ahab, but
thou ██████ right; live in the game, and die in it!"



CHAPTER ███. The Candles.


███████ climes but nurse the █████████ fangs: the tiger of Bengal
████████ in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent
but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes
that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these
resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all
storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that █████████
sky, like an █████████ ████ upon a █████ and sleepy town.

Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-█████ was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder, and ██████ with the lightning, that showed the ████████ masts
██████████ here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport.

Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every
flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster
might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask
were directing the men in the higher hoisting and ██████ lashing of the
boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very
top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape.
A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship's high
█████████ side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern, and left it
again, all dripping through like a █████.

"Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
"but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can't fight it. You see,
Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all
round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all
the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never
mind; it's all in fun: so the old song says;"--(SINGS.)

  Oh! jolly is the gale,
  And a joker is the whale,
  A' ██████████' his tail,--
  Such a funny, ██████, ████, █████, ████, ████-████ lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  The scud all a █████',
  That's his flip only ██████';
  When he stirs in the ██████',--
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

  Thunder ██████ the ships,
  But he only ██████ his lips,
  A ██████' of this flip,--
  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!


"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
peace."

"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat. And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a
wind-up."

"Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."

"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
mind how foolish?"

"Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow, "███████ thou not that the gale comes from
the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very
course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is
that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand--his
stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
must!

"I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?"

"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the ████████ way to
Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's
question. "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see it ████████ up
there; but not with the lightning."

At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
instant a ██████ of thunder █████ rolled overhead.

"Who's there?"

"Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire.

Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
as this █████████ must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many ███████, besides ███████████
not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less ████████ the
vessel's way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.

"The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to
vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting █████████,
to light Ahab to his post. "Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and
aft. Quick!"

"Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the ██████
side. Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that
all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir."

"Look aloft!" cried Starbuck. "The ██████████! the corpusants!"

All the yard-arms were ██████ with a pallid fire; and touched at each
███-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that ██████████ air, like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

"Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. "Blast it!"--but
slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The corpusants have mercy on us
all!"

To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they ██████ over to a seething
sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His "████, Mene,
█████ ████████" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.

While this ██████████ was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
all their eyes ████████ in that pale ███████████████, like a far away
constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic
jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed
the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of
Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as
if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the
preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like ███████ blue
flames on his body.

The ███████ all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It
was Stubb. "What ████████ thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the
same in the song."

"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?--have
they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck--but it's too dark
to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
█████ a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will
work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will
yet be as three spermaceti candles--that's the good promise we saw."

At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and once
more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
████████████████ in their pallor.

"The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.

At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head bowed away
from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
arrested by the glare, now ███████ together, and hung pendulous, like a
knot of ██████ █████ from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted
attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in
███████████, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes
██████.

"Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab. "Look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast
links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it;
blood against fire! So."

Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he
stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.

"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
once did worship, till in the ███████████ act so burned by thee, that to
this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now
know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence
wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all
are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
█████████ power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
███████ its unconditional, ██████████ ███████ in me. In the midst of the
personified impersonal, a ███████████ stands here. Though but a point at
best; █████████'er I came; ████████'er I go; yet while I earthly live,
the ███████ personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But war
is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will
kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere ████████ power;
and though thou █████████ navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that
in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy
fire thou ██████ me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to
thee."

[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE
TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST, ██████ HIS EYES,
HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]

"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it █████
from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then
grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of
these poor eyes, and ███████-hands. I would not take it. The lightning
flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten
brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some ████████ ground. Oh, oh!
Yet █████████, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou
███████ out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping
out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the
flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my █████████. But thou
art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what
hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.
Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself ██████████;
certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself ███████. I
know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.
There is some ███████████ thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom
all thy eternity is but time, all thy ████████████ mechanical. Through
thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou
foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable
riddle, thy ██████████████ grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read
my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with
thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!"

"The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"

Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat's
bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there
like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm--"God, God
is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."

Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces--though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a █████ among them; swearing to
████████ with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end.
Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:--

"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as ███████ as mine; and
heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
the last fear!" And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
flame.

As in the hurricane that ██████ the plain, men fly the ████████████ of
some lone, gigantic ███, whose very height and strength but render it so
much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts;
so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him
in a terror of dismay.



CHAPTER ███. The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.

AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM. STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM.


"We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose
and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?"

"Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up
now."

"Sir!--in God's name!--sir?"

"Well."

"The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them ███████?"

"Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.--By
masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
████████ smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, ████████! Loftiest
trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now
sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards
send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a ████████ aloft
there! I would e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the █████
is a noisy ██████. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!"



CHAPTER ███. Midnight.--The Forecastle Bulwarks.


STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL ████████ OVER
THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.


"No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you
will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long
ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn't you once say that
whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its
insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft
and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn't you say so?"

"Well, suppose I did? What then? I've part changed my flesh since that
time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with powder
barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
█████ in this █████████ spray here? Why, my little man, you have
pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself; you're
Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill ████████ at your coat
collar. Don't you see, then, that for these extra █████ the Marine
Insurance companies have extra ██████████? Here are ████████, Flask. But
hark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off
from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;
now listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's
lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn't
got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you timber-head,
that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first
struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred
carries rods, and Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more
danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand
ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would
have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running
up the corner of his hat, like a ███████ officer's ████████ feather,
and ████████ behind like his ████. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be
sensible."

"I don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard."

"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's
a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the
turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And what
big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron █████,
hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is
anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable,
though. There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So; next to
touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just
█████ out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-████
so, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn
in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry
off the water, d'ye see. Same with ██████ hats; the cocks form gable-end
████-███████, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I
must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew!
there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come
from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a █████ night, lad."



CHAPTER ███. Midnight Aloft.--Thunder and Lightning.


THE MAIN-TOP-SAIL YARD.--TASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND IT.


"Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here. What's
the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don't want thunder; we want rum; give
us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!"



CHAPTER ███. The Musket.


During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod's
jaw-bone tiller had several times been █████████ hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions, even though █████████ tackles had been attached
to it--for they were slack--because some play to the tiller was
indispensable.

In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed ███████████
to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the
Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is
a sight that hardly ██████ can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion.

Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
█████████ █████████ of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward and the
other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when
that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.

The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
storm-███████ was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,
East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo!
a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze
became fair!

Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "HO! THE
FAIR WIND! OH-YE-HO, ███████ MEN!" the crew singing for joy, that so
promising an event should so soon have █████████ the evil portents
preceding it.

In ██████████ with the standing order of his commander--to report
immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change
in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner ███████ the yards to
the breeze--however ███████████ and gloomily,--than he mechanically went
below to ███████ Captain Ahab of the circumstance.

Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it
a moment. The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was
burning ████████, and casting ██████ shadows upon the old man's bolted
door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper ██████.
The isolated █████████████████ of the cabin made a certain humming
silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of
the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were █████████ revealed, as
they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest,
upright man; but out of Starbuck's heart, at that instant when he saw
the muskets, there strangely ███████ an evil thought; but so blent with
its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew
it for itself.

"He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very musket
that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let me touch
it--lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances,
strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and
powder in the pan;--that's not good. Best █████ it?--wait. I'll cure
myself of this. I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.--I come
to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and
doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick. It's a fair wind that's only fair for
that accursed fish.--The very tube he pointed at me!--the very one;
THIS one--I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I
handle now.--Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say
he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly
quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, ██████ he not his way by mere
dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did
he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed
old man be tamely ████████ to drag a whole ship's company down to doom
with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my
soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this
instant--put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in
his sleep? Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping. Sleeping? aye,
but still alive, and soon awake again. I can't withstand thee, then, old
man. Not reasoning; not ████████████; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to;
all this thou ████████. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is
all thou █████████. Aye, and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st
all of us are █████. Great God ██████!--But is there no other way? no
██████ way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest
this old man's living power from his own living hands? Only a fool
would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes
and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would
be more hideous than a █████ tiger, then. I could not endure the
sight; could not possibly fly his ████████; all comfort, sleep itself,
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What,
then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan
the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and
a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis so.--Is heaven
a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed,
█████████ sheets and skin together?--And would I be a murderer, then,
if"--and slowly, ██████████, and half sideways looking, he placed the
loaded musket's end against the door.

"On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way. A
touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh
Mary! Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day week
may sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall
I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
are reefed and set; she heads her course."

"Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"

Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb dream
to speak.

The yet levelled musket shook like a ████████'s arm against the █████;
Starbuck seemed █████████ with an angel; but turning from the door, he
placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.

"He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know'st what to say."



CHAPTER ███. The Needle.


Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her on
like giants' palms █████████. The strong, ████████████ breeze ████████
so, that sky and air seemed vast ███████████ sails; the whole world
██████ before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible
sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his
bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned ██████████
kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of
██████ gold, that ██████████ leaps with light and heat.

Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
the ████████ ship ██████████ pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's ████████ place, and how
the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.

"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!"

But suddenly ██████ back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
helm, ███████ demanding how the ship was heading.

"East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.

"Thou █████!" smiting him with his clenched fist. "Heading East at this
hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"

Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
blinding ████████████ must have been the cause.

Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse
of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.

But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew,
the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it! It has happened
before. Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our compasses--that's
all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it."

"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale mate,
gloomily.

Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
the ███████████ beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled
at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has
actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and
rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal;
all its █████████ virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle. But in
either case, the needle never again, of itself, ████████ the original
virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected,
the same fate ███████ all the others that may be in the ship; even were
the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.

Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the ████████████
compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's course to be
changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
one had only been juggling her.

Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask--who
in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings--likewise
█████████████ ██████████. As for the men, though some of them lowly
███████, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly ███████████;
or if impressed, it was only with a certain █████████ shot into their
congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab's.

For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sight-█████ of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.

"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked
thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But
Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck--a lance without
a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's needles.
Quick!"

Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse █████████ the thing he was now about
to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old
man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though ████████
practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
without some ███████████ and evil portents.

"Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder turned old Ahab's
needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that
will point as true as any."

Abashed glances of ███████ wonder were █████████ by the sailors, as this
was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
follow. But Starbuck looked away.

With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul,
after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the
███████ needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered
that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then
going through some small strange motions with it--whether indispensable
to the ███████████ of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe
of the crew, is uncertain--he called for linen thread; and moving to the
binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards.
At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at
either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had
been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the
binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look
ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun
is East, and that compass swears it!"

One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they █████
away.

In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
fatal pride.



CHAPTER ███. The Log and Line.


While now the █████ Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident ████████
upon other means of ███████████ the vessel's place, some merchantmen,
and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly ███████ to heave the
log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form's sake than
anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
███████ of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had ██████ it; sun and
wind had ██████ it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,
and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic
oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing ██████████;
astern the billows rolled in riots.

"Forward, there! Heave the log!"

Two seamen came. The golden-hued ████████ and the ███████ Manxman. "Take
the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."

They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where the
deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.

The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
handle-ends of the ███████, round which the █████ of line revolved, so
stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.

Ahab stood before him, and was lightly █████████ some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
speak.

"Sir, I ████████ it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it."

"'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
Thou seem'st to hold. Or, █████ perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it."

"I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these
grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a
superior, who'll ne'er confess."

"What's that? There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
granite-founded College; but methinks he's too ███████████. Where wert
thou born?"

"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."

"Excellent! Thou'st hit the world by that."

"I know not, sir, but I was born there."

"In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it's good. Here's a man
from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now ████████ of Man;
which is sucked in--by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So."

The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
turn, █████████ raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
resistance of the log caused the old ███████ to stagger strangely.

"Hold hard!"

Snap! the ████████████ line ██████ down in one long festoon; the ███████
log was gone.

"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
mend thou the line. See to it."

"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer
seems █████████ out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,
Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"

"Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip's missing.
Let's see now if ye haven't ██████ him up here, fisherman. It drags
hard; I guess he's holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul
in no cowards here. Ho! there's his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."

"Peace, thou crazy ████," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
"Away from the quarter-deck!"

"The greater idiot ever ██████ the ██████," muttered Ahab, advancing.
"Hands off from that ████████! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?

"Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!"

"And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
through! Who art thou, boy?"

"Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ████, ████, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip!
One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks
████████--quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip the
coward?"

"There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look
down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him,
ye ████████ ██████████. Here, boy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's home
henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou ████████ my inmost centre, boy; thou
art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-███████. Come, let's down."

"What's this? here's velvet shark-skin," intently gazing at Ahab's hand,
and feeling it. "Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this,
perhaps he had ne'er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope;
something that ████ souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come
and █████ these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I
will not let this go."

"Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye █████████ in
gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man; and man, though ███████, and knowing not
what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and █████████. Come!
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
Emperor's!"

"There go two ████ ones now," muttered the old Manxman. "One daft with
strength, the other daft with weakness. But here's the end of the ██████
line--all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new
line altogether. I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."



CHAPTER ███. The Life-Buoy.


Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her progress
solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod held on
her path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
████████████ waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled
by unvarying trade winds, over waves ████████████ mild; all these seemed
the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.

At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the
dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then headed
by Flask--was startled by a cry so ███████████ wild and unearthly--like
half-articulated ████████ of the ghosts of all █████'s murdered
█████████--that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for
the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all ████████████
listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained
within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was
mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled.
Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest mariner of all--declared that the wild
thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men
in the sea.

Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
explained the wonder.

Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
of seals, and some young seals that had lost their ████, or some dams
that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company
with her, crying and ███████ with their human sort of wail. But this
only the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a
very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their
peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their
round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen █████████ uprising from
the water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have
more than once been mistaken for men.

But the ███████ of the crew were destined to receive a most █████████
████████████ in the fate of one of their number that morning. At
sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
and whether it was that he was not yet half █████ from his sleep (for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus
with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he
had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a
rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
sea.

The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had ████████, so that it
slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every ████; and
the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
yield him his pillow, though in █████ but a hard one.

And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out
for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground; that man
was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the
time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
least as a ███████; for they regarded it, not as a █████████████ of evil
in the future, but as the ██████████ of an evil already ████████. They
declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had
heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.

The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
to it; but as no cask of sufficient █████████ could be found, and as
in the ████████ eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a
buoy, when by certain strange signs and █████████ Queequeg hinted a hint
concerning his coffin.

"A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.

"Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.

"It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can
███████ it easily."

"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a
melancholy pause. "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the coffin,
I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it."

"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a hammer.

"Aye."

"And shall I █████ the seams, sir?" moving his hand as with a
████████-iron.

"Aye."

"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand as
with a pitch-pot.

"Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."

"He goes off in a ████. The whole he can endure; at the parts he ██████.
Now I don't like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it
like a gentleman; but I make a ███████ for Queequeg, and he won't put
his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin?
And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old
coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don't like this
████████ sort of business--I don't like it at all; it's ███████████;
it's not my place. Let ███████' █████ do ██████████; we are their
███████. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square
mathematical ████, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and
is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not
a ███████'s job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at
the end. It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord!
what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of
sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's
the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when
I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their
lonely old heads to run off with me. But █████-ho! there are no caps at
sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay
over the same with pitch; ██████ them down tight, and hang it with the
snap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before
with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied
up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of ██████
█████████ ███████; I don't budge. █████████ with a coffin! Sailing
about with a grave-yard ████! But never mind. We ███████ in woods make
bridal-█████████ and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We
work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask
the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling,
and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now, tenderly.
I'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told? But
I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed
life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then,
if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for
one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer,
caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it."



CHAPTER ███. The Deck.


THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE OPEN
HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM
SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF
HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND HEARS PIP
FOLLOWING HIM.


"Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
████████ with my humor more ████████ than that boy.--Middle █████ of a
church! What's here?"

"Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck's orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
hatchway!"

"Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault."

"Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does."

"Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy
shop?"

"I believe it did, sir; does the ███████ stand, sir?"

"Well enough. But art thou not also the ██████████?"

"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
they've set me now to turning it into something else."

"Then tell me; art thou not an ██████, all-grasping, █████████████,
monopolising, heathenish old █████, to be one day making legs, and the
next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
jack-of-all-trades."

"But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do."

"The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin? The ██████, they say, hummed snatches when ████████ out the
███████ for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
hand. Dost thou never?"

"Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark
to it."

"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what in
all things makes the sounding-board is this--there's naught beneath. And
yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
Hast thou ever helped carry a ████, and heard the coffin knock against
the churchyard gate, going in?

"Faith, sir, I've--"

"Faith? What's that?"

"Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,
sir."

"Um, um; go on."

"I was about to say, sir, that--"

"Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
Look at thy bosom! ████████! and get these traps out of sight."

"He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes. I've heard that the Isle of █████████, one of the Gallipagos,
is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of
Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He's always under
the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye! He's looking this way--come, oakum;
quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I'm the
professor of ███████ glasses--tap, tap!"

(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)

"There's a sight! There's a sound! The grey-headed ██████████ tapping
the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be ██████ now. See! that
thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag,
that fellow. Rat-███! So man's ███████ ████! Oh! how ██████████ are all
materials! What things real are there, but ████████████ thoughts? Here
now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made
the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life.
A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some
spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
I'll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth,
that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed
sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return
again. Now, then, Pip, we'll talk this over; I do ████ most wondrous
████████████ from thee! Some unknown ████████ from the unknown worlds
must empty into thee!"



CHAPTER ███. The Pequod Meets The ██████.


Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly ██████████ with men. At the
time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the ████████ sails all
fell together as blank ████████ that are burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hull.

"Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.

"Hast seen the White Whale?"

"Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"

██████████ his joy, Ahab ██████████ answered this unexpected question;
and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain
himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen descending her
side. A few keen █████, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod's
main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by
Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.

"Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely advancing.
"How was it?"

It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while
three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which
had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were
yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had
suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon,
the fourth rigged boat--a reserved one--had been instantly lowered in
chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat--the ████████
keeled of all--seemed to have succeeded in fastening--at least, as
well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the
distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift █████
of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was
concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
his pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no
positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging;
darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward
boats--ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
direction--the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to
its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance
from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a fire
in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out.
But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the
presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then
paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding
anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and
though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least
glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.

The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.

"I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some one
in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap, his
watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of
the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks--pale in the
very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the coat--it must have been
the--"

"My boy, my own boy is among them. For God's sake--I beg, I
███████"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
had but █████ received his ████████. "For eight-and-forty hours let me
███████ your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and ███████ pay for it--if
there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only that--you
must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing."

"His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost! I take back the
coat and watch--what says Ahab? We must save that boy."

"He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx
sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their spirits."

Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel's
the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew; but among
the number of the other boat's crews, at the same time, but on the other
hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase,
there had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched
father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which
was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively ████████ the
ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when
placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the
majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,
had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by
Ahab's ███████ did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad,
but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but ███████████
█████████ of a Nantucketer's ████████ love, had thus early sought to
████████ him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially
the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that
Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them,
for a protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than
their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall
be ███████████ by any chance ███████ of a father's natural but untimely
██████████, or █████ apprehensiveness and concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor ████ of Ahab;
and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
the least quivering of his own.

"I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me. Do to me
as you would have me do to you in the like case. For YOU too have a boy,
Captain Ahab--though but a child, and ████████ safely at home now--a
child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you ██████; I see it--run, run,
men, now, and stand by to square in the yards."

"Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that
████████████ moulded every word--"Captain ████████, I will not do it.
Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
███████ myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch,
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:
then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before."

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain ██████████ at this unconditional and utter
█████████ of his so earnest suit. But starting from his ███████████,
Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
boat, and returned to his ship.

Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;
starboard and larboard, she continued to ████; now she beat against a
head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall ██████
trees, when the boys are █████████ among the boughs.

But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw
that this ship that so ████ with spray, still remained without comfort.
She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.



CHAPTER ███. The Cabin.


(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)

"Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming
when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him.
There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady.
Like █████ like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired
health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if
thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed
chair; another screw to it, thou must be."

"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a
part of ye."

"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a █████ in the ████████
fidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks like-cures-like
applies to him too; he █████ so sane again."

"They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
ye."

"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in him.
I tell thee no; it cannot be."

"Oh good master, master, master!

"Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!--Met! True art
thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
thee; and if it come to that,--God for ever save thee, let what will
befall."

(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)


"Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,--but I'm alone. Now
were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing. Pip! Pip!
Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip? He must be up here; let's try the
door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there's no opening
it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this
screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom,
in the ship's full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me.
Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-█████ great
admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and
███████████. Ha! what's this? ████████! epaulets! the epaulets all come
crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, █████████!
What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy's host to white men with gold
lace upon their coats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--a little
negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a
whale-boat once;--seen him? No! Well then, fill up again, captains, and
let's drink shame upon all cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them!
Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above there,
I hear ivory--Oh, master! master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk
over me. But here I'll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they
█████ through; and oysters come to join me."



CHAPTER ███. The Hat.


And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to
have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with
various ships █████████████ █████████ to show the demoniac indifference
with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether ███████ or ██████
against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes,
which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the █████████
polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months' night
████████ its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now
fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
██████████ above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf.

In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove
to █████ one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to
finest dust, and ████████, for the time, in the ███████ mortar of
Ahab's iron soul. Like ████████, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever
conscious that the old man's ██████ eye was on them.

But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
even as Ahab's eyes so ████ the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's glance
awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
being's body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by
night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his ███
but wondrous eyes did plainly say--We two ████████ never rest.

Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or
exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating ██████,--the main-mast
and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,--his
living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched
heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the
days and nights were added on, that he had not swung in his hammock;
yet hidden beneath that █████████ hat, they could never tell unerringly
whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether
he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp
gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The
clothes that the night had wet, the next day's ████████ dried upon him;
and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath
the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.

He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast and
dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew
all ███████, as █████████ roots of trees blown over, which still grow
idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though
his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee's
mystic watch was without ████████████ as his own; yet these two never
seemed to speak--one man to the other--unless at long intervals some
passing ███████████ matter made it necessary. Though such a potent spell
seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew,
they seemed pole-like ███████. If by day they chanced to speak one word;
by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal
interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they
stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by
the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
Parsee Ahab saw his ██████████ shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned
substance.

And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, ████████████ revealed to his ████████████,--Ahab
seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
seemed yoked together, and an unseen ██████ driving them; the lean shade
██████ the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel
was solid Ahab.

At the first faintest ██████████ of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day, till after
sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of
the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye see?--sharp! sharp!"

But when three or four days had ██████ by, after meeting the
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at least, of nearly
all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if
these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally
expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.

"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--he said. "Aye!
Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest
of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
downward-██████ rope; and █████████ one to his basket prepared a pin for
the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon
his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon
Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but ████████ Fedallah; and then settling his
firm ███████ eye upon the chief mate, said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give
it into thy hands, Starbuck." Then █████████ his person in the basket,
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being
the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And
thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad
upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and
that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.

When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no ████████, the sailor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a
wilderness of running rigging, whose various different █████████ aloft
cannot always be infallibly █████████ by what is seen of them at the
deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes
cast down from the ██████████, it would be but a natural fatality, if,
unprovided with a constant ████████, the hoisted sailor should by some
████████████ of the crew be cast adrift and fall all ████████ to the
sea. So Ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only
strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one
only man who had ever ████████ to oppose him with anything in the
slightest degree approaching to decision--one of those too, whose
faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was
strange, that this was the very man he should ██████ for his watchman;
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's
hands.

Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
minutes; one of those red-██████ savage sea-hawks which so often fly
██████████████ close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
in a maze of ███████████ swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet
straight up into the air; then ██████████ downwards, and went eddying
again round his head.

But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sight.

"Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though
somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
them.

But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long
hooked bill at his head: with a ██████, the black ████ darted away with
his prize.

An eagle flew thrice round ███████'s head, removing his cap to ███████
it, and thereupon ████████, his wife, declared that Tarquin would
be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
accounted good. Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and
on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while
from the point of that █████████████, a minute black spot was dimly
discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.



CHAPTER ███. The Pequod Meets The Delight.


The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
████████ the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams, called ██████, which, in some whaling-ships,
cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to
carry the spare, ████████, or disabled boats.

Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
half-unhinged, and █████████ skeleton of a horse.

"Hast seen the White Whale?"

"Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.

"Hast killed him?"

"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the
other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
sides some noiseless sailors were busy in ██████ together.

"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs;
and I swear to temper them ██████ in that hot place behind the fin,
where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"

"Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the
hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only THAT one I bury; the rest were
buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb." Then turning to his
crew--"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
lift the body; so, then--Oh! God"--advancing towards the hammock with
uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life--"

"Brace forward! Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.

But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
her hull with their ghostly ███████.

As Ahab now glided from the ████████ Delight, the strange life-buoy
hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.

"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
"In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
taffrail to show us your coffin!"



CHAPTER ███. The ████████.


It was a clear steel-blue day. The ██████████ of air and sea were
hardly █████████ in that all-pervading azure; only, the ███████ air was
█████████████ pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and
man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as ██████'s
chest in his sleep.

Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
██████████ birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
troubled, murderous thinkings of the █████████ sea.

But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the ███, as it were,
that distinguished them.

Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to █████. And at the
girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen
here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.

Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; █████████ firm
and ██████████; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
ashes of ruin; ███████████ Ahab stood forth in the █████████ of the
morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
forehead of heaven.

Oh, immortal infancy, and █████████ of the azure! Invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed █████, ██████████ ██████ around
their old sire; sporting with the circle of ██████ locks which grew on
the █████ of that burnt-out crater of his brain.

Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
██████ in that enchanted air did at last seem to ██████, for a moment,
the █████████ thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome
sky, did at last stroke and ██████ him; the step-mother world, so long
cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck,
and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however
wilful and ██████, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to
bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea;
nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one ███ drop.

Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch
him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.

Ahab turned.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir."

"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first whale--a
boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty--forty--forty years ago!--ago! Forty
years of continual whaling! forty years of █████████, and peril, and
storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
████████ the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation
of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's
exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
green country without--oh, weariness! █████████! Guinea-coast ███████ of
solitary command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so
keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon dry
salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when the
███████ landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
world's fresh bread to my mouldy ██████--away, whole oceans away, from
that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow--wife?
wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor
girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the ██████,
the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand
lowerings old Ahab has furiously, █████████ chased his prey--more a
demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a forty years' fool--fool--old fool,
has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy
the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or
better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this
weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under
me? Here, █████ this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.
Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look
very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and
humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled
centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!--crack my heart!--stave my
brain!--███████! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have
I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?
Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is
better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By
the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass,
man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on
board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.
That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see
in that eye!"

"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us
fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are
Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, ████████, play-fellow
youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!--this instant let me alter
the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such
mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."

"They have, they have. I have seen them--some summer days in the
morning. About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy
vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
to dance him again."

"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's
sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy's face
from the window! the boy's hand on the hill!"

But Ahab's glance was averted; like a ████████ fruit tree he shook, and
cast his last, ████████ apple to the soil.

"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural ███████ and ████████, I so keep
pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power;
how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think
thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that
living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in
this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
████████! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been
making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the
mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how
we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid
greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut
swaths--Starbuck!"

But ████████ to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.

Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was ████████████
leaning over the same rail.



CHAPTER ███. The Chase--First Day.


That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at
intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing nigh to
some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
surprised when, after ██████████ the compass, and then the dog-████, and
then ████████████ the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible,
Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered, and the
sail to be █████████.

The █████ policy dictating these movements was sufficiently ██████████
at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
wrinkles █████████ it, the polished ████████-like marks of some swift
tide-███, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

"Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!"

Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
with their clothes in their hands.

"What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, ██████████ his face to the sky.

"Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.

"T'gallant sails!--█████████! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"

All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft,
and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
air. "There she blows!--there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
Moby Dick!"

Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's
head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
his high sparkling hump, and regularly ███████ his silent spout into the
air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
so long ago beheld in the ███████ Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

"And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
all around him.

"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
cried out," said Tashtego.

"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the
White Whale first. There she blows!--there she blows!--there she blows!
There again!--there again!" he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, ████████
tones, ███████ to the gradual ███████████ of the whale's visible jets.
"He's going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by
three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.
Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go
flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by,
stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he
slid through the air to the deck.

"He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away from
us; cannot have seen the ship yet."

"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!--brace up!
Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that! Boats, boats!"

Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails
set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

Like noiseless ████████ shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came
so nigh his seemingly ████████████ prey, that his entire dazzling hump
was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish
foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head
beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-██████ waters, went
the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical
rippling █████████ accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters
███████████████ flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly
██████████ the sea, █████████ with their fitful flight; and like to
some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but
shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;
and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and
to and fro ████████ like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and
rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers █████████ like ███████.

A gentle ██████████--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
████████ ██████ clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth ██████████ fleetness,
rippling straight for the ███████ bower in █████; not Jove, not that
great majesty Supreme! did ███████ the glorified White Whale as he so
divinely swam.

On each soft side--██████████ with the parted swell, that but once
leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale
shed off █████████. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
██████████ transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
to ██████ it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
tornadoes. Yet calm, ████████ calm, oh, whale! thou ███████ on, to all
who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
thou may'st have █████████ and destroyed before.

And thus, through the serene ██████████████ of the tropical sea, among
waves whose hand-█████████ were suspended by exceeding ███████, Moby
Dick moved on, still ███████████ from sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant
his whole ██████████ body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural
Bridge, and █████████ waving his ████████ flukes in the air, the
grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. ██████████
halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered
over the agitated pool that he left.

With oars █████, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the
three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.

"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed
beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide ██████
vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now
█████████; the sea began to swell.

"The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.

In long Indian file, as when ██████ take wing, the white birds were
now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
█████████ cries. Their vision was ██████ than man's; Ahab could discover
no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its
depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
██████, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,
till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked
rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the ██████████████
bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and ████████ jaw; his vast,
shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The
glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-██████ marble
tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to stern.

Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its
bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet
under water. But as if perceiving this █████████, Moby Dick, with that
malicious intelligence ascribed to him, ██████████ transplanted himself,
as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath
the boat.

Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it ████████ for
an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of
a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's
head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
████████████ eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the
uttermost stern.

And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
whale ███████ with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and
while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very jaws he hated; ████████ with all this, he seized
the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
█████ gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,
and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two
floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew
at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast
to the oars to lash them across.

At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
to perceive the whale's intent, by the ██████ █████████ of his head, a
movement that ██████ his hold for the time; at that moment his hand
had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only
slipping further into the whale's mouth, and ███████ over sideways as it
slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of
it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.

██████████ withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole ████████ body;
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or more feet
out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
dazzlingly broke against it; ████████████ tossing their shivered spray
still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled ███████
billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to
████████ its summit with their scud.


*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its ███████████
(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down
█████ of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously
described. By this motion the whale must best and most ███████████████
view whatever objects may be encircling him.


But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to ██████ him, as the blood of
grapes and ██████████ cast before █████████'s elephants in the book
of █████████. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's
████████ tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still
keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless
Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah ███████████ and
mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.
For so ███████████ appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so
███████████ swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed
horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed,
still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to
strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they
themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on
the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old
man's head.

Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's
mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--"Sail on
the"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and
whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him
off!"

The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam
off, the boats flew to the rescue.

Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
██████ in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily strength did
crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for a time, lying
all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one ███████ under foot
of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as
desolate sounds from out ███████.

But this intensity of his physical ███████████ did but so much the more
██████████ it. In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep ████, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through ███████ men's whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary
in each one suffering; still, if the gods ██████ it, in their
life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
███████████; for even in their █████████ ███████, those noble natures
contain the entire ██████████████ of inferior souls.

"The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and ██████████ leaning on one
bended arm--"is it safe?"

"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing it.

"Lay it before me;--any missing men?"

"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here are
five men."

"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands off from me!
The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again! Set the sail; out oars;
the helm!"

It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus
continued with what is called double-██████ oars. It was thus now. But
the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,
for he seemed to have ██████-banked his every fin; swimming with a
velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,
pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a
hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an
unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable
only in some one brief ███████████. The ship itself, then, as it
sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of
██████████ the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were
soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having
been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her
side, and ████████ her canvas high up, and sideways █████████████ it
with stun-sails, like the double-███████ wings of an albatross; the
Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,
methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced
from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone
down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch
in hand, so soon as the last second of the ████████ hour expired, his
voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon now? D'ye see him?" and if the
reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his
perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless;
anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.

As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,
or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still
greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at
every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon
the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern.
At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-███████ sky fresh
troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face
there now stole some such added gloom as this.

Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps █████████, not vainly, though, to
evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed--"The
███████ the ass refused; it ███████ his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!"

"What ████████ thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did
I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear
thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck."

"Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight; an omen,
and an ill one."

"Omen? omen?--the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will ██████████ speak outright; not shake their heads, and
give an old wives' ████████ hint.--Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and
ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of
the ███████ earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold--I
shiver!--How now? Aloft there! D'ye see him? Sing out for every spout,
though he spout ten times a second!"

The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was ████████.
Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained █████.

"Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark"--cried a voice from the air.

"How heading when last seen?"

"As before, sir,--straight to leeward."

"Good! he will travel ██████ now 'tis night. Down royals and top-gallant
stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he's
making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her
full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand
to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning."--Then advancing
towards the doubloon in the main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I
earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead;
and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall be
killed, this gold is that man's; and if on that day I shall again raise
him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away
now!--the deck is thine, sir!"

And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
███████ himself to see how the night wore on.



CHAPTER ███. The Chase--Second Day.


At day-break, the three mast-heads were ██████████ manned afresh.

"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
to spread.

"See nothing, sir."

"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her all
night. But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."

Here be it said, that this ████████████ pursuit of one particular whale,
continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
wonderful skill, ██████████ of experience, and ██████████ confidence
acquired by some great natural ████████ among the Nantucket commanders;
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they
will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately ████████ both
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of
a coast, whose general ████████ he well knows, and which he desires
shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this
pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the
fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and
diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night
████████ the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the
pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the
██████████ ███████████ of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the
mighty iron Leviathan of the modern ███████ is so familiarly known in
its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as
doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour;
even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that
other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his
speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have
gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of
latitude or longitude. But to render this █████████ at all successful in
the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what
present avail to the becalmed or █████████ mariner is the skill that
assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his
port? █████████ from these statements, are many collateral subtile
matters touching the chase of whales.

The ship tore on; leaving such a ██████ in the sea as when a
cannon-ball, ███████, becomes a ██████-share and turns up the level
field.

"By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck
██████ up one's legs and ███████ at the heart. This ship and I are two
brave fellows!--Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and ██████ me, spine-wise,
on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
that leaves no dust behind!"

"There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the
mast-head cry.

"Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and
split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
trump--███████ your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a ██████
█████ his █████████ upon the stream!"

And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The ████████
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
as timid prairie █████ that scatter before the ████████ bison. The hand
of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of
the previous day; the rack of the past night's ████████; the fixed,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so ████████ them to the race.

They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and █████,
and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
directed by the long central keel; even so, all the ███████████████ of
the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and ██████████, all
varieties were welded into ███████, and were all directed to that fatal
goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.

The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
██████████████ tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
hand, some reached forth the other with impatient ███████; others,
███████ their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite ████████ to
seek out the thing that might destroy them!

"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet
that way, and then disappears."

It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope ███████ to its
pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an █████████, that made the
air ███████ as with the combined ██████████ of ██████. The triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as--much nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead--Moby Dick
bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of █████████. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,
the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the
distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged
waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his
act of defiance.

"There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his
immeasurable █████████ the White Whale tossed himself ██████-like to
Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
against the still █████ margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
the moment, intolerably █████████ and glared like a glacier; and
stood there gradually ██████ and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity, to the dim █████████ of an advancing shower in a vale.

"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour and
thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore.
The boats!--stand by!"

Unmindful of the tedious rope-███████ of the shrouds, the men, like
shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
halyards; while Ahab, less █████████, but still rapidly was dropped from
his perch.

"Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare one,
rigged the afternoon previous. "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine--keep
away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!"

As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them
he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull straight up to his
forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such
a course ████████ the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.
But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing
among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling
battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
boat, seemed only intent on ████████████ each separate plank of which
those boats were made. But skilfully ██████████, incessantly wheeling
like ███████ ████████ in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;
though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's
unearthly ██████ tore every other cry but his to shreds.

But at last in his ███████████ ██████████, the White Whale so crossed
and █████████, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they █████████████, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again--██████
that way to ███████████ it of some ██████--when lo!--a sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks!

Caught and twisted--███████████ in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one
thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel; dragged in
the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice
sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the intercepted █████ of
steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White
Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining ███████ of the other lines;
by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and
Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling █████ on
a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round, like the ██████ ██████ in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch.

While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
██████ little Flask ██████ up and down like an empty vial, █████████ his
legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was ███████
singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man's
line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils,--Ahab's yet ██████████ boat seemed drawn up towards
Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men █████████ out from under
it, like seals from a sea-side cave.

The first uprising momentum of the whale--█████████ its direction as
he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
or █████ of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean, and trailing after him the ████████████ lines, continued his
leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.

As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and
safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and
ankles; livid ██████████; wrenched harpoons and lances; ████████████
intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As
with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to
his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor
did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.

But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp ████████.

"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the ██████ who he
will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."

"The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up; "I
put good work into that leg."

"But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.

"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even with
a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of
mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost. Nor white whale,
nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and
inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"

"Dead to leeward, sir."

"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat's
crews."

"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."

"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter █████ me now! Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"

"Sir?"

"My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane--there, that
shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."

The old man's hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
Parsee was not there.

"The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"

"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"

But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
nowhere to be found.

"Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--I
thought I saw him dragging under."

"MY line! MY line? Gone?--gone? What means that little word?--What
death-█████ rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see it?--the forged
iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered fool! this hand did
dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there! Keep him nailed--Quick!--all
hands to the rigging of the boats--███████ the oars--harpooneers!
the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a pull on all the
sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life! I'll ten times girdle
the ██████████ globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I'll slay
him yet!

"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck;
"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In █████' name no more of
this, that's worse than devil's madness. Two days chased; twice stove
to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
shadow gone--all good angels ███████ thee with warnings:--

"What more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish
till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom
of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh,
oh,--███████ and blasphemy to hunt him more!"

"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes. But in this
matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
hand--a ███████, ██████████ blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
whole act's █████████ decreed. 'Twas rehearsed by thee and me a ███████
years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act
under orders. Look thou, █████████! that thou ███████ mine.--Stand round
me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
lance; ███████ up on a lonely foot. 'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but
Ahab's soul's a █████████, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale;
and I may look so. But ere I break, ye'll hear me crack; and till ye hear
THAT, know that Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in
the things called █████? Then laugh aloud, and cry ██████! For ere they
drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again,
to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--████████
will be the third. Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to spout
his last! D'ye feel brave men, brave?"

"As fearless fire," cried Stubb.

"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: "The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine!--The
Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go before:--but still was
to be seen again ere I could perish--How's that?--There's a riddle now
might ██████ all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line
of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain. I'LL, I'LL solve it,
though!"

When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of
Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as
on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his
███, ██████████ glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
eastward for the earliest sun.



CHAPTER ███. The Chase.--Third Day.


The morning of the third day ██████ fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all. Helm
there; steady, as thou █████, and hast been going. What a lovely day
again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
██████ day could not dawn upon that world. Here's food for thought, had
Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
THAT'S tingling enough for mortal man! to think's audacity. God only has
that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a
calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much
for that. And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen
calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents
turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this
moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that sort
of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy ██████ of
Greenland ice or in Vesuvius ████. How the wild winds blow it; they whip
it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they
cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison
█████████ and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ██████████ them, and
now comes blowing hither as innocent as ███████. Out upon it!--it's
███████. Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable
world. I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and █████ there. And yet, 'tis a
noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight
it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run
through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not
stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a ██████ thing--a nobler
thing than THAT. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things
that most ██████████ and outrage mortal man, all these things are
████████, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There's a most
special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I
say again, and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and
gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the
clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous
mildness; and ████ not from their mark, however the █████ currents of
the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest █████████████ of the land swift
and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal
Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these
Trades, or something like them--something so ████████████, and full as
strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d'ye see?"

"Nothing, sir."

"Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
Aye, aye, it must be so. I've ██████████ him. How, got the start? Aye,
he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might have known it, too.
Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by
last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
outs! Man the braces!"

Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
quarter, so that now being pointed in the ███████ direction, the braced
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she █████████ the cream in her own
white wake.

"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck to
himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. "God keep
us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my
flesh. I ████████ me that I disobey my God in obeying him!"

"Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
"We should meet him soon."

"Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once
more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three
mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had ██████
it.

"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye. He's too
far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there's
time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
not changed a ████ since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
Nantucket! The same!--the same!--the same to Noah as to me. There's
a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely ███████████! They must lead
somewhere--to something else than common land, more palmy than the
palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward,
then; the better if the ████████ quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
mast-head! What's this?--green? aye, ████ mosses in these warped cracks.
No such green weather stains on Ahab's head! There's the difference now
between man's old age and matter's. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus
a leg, that's all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
flesh every way. I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made
of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of
vital fathers. What's that he said? he should still go before me, my
pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the
bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all
night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye,
like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee;
but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head--keep a good
eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone. We'll talk to-morrow, nay,
to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail."

He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his ███████'s
stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him pause.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir?"

"For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck."

"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."

"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
Starbuck!"

"Truth, sir: saddest truth."

"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of
the flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,
Starbuck. I am old;--shake hands with me, man."

Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.

"Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's a
brave man that █████; how great the agony of the ██████████ then!"

"Lower away!"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him. "Stand by
the crew!"

In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

"The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;
"O master, my master, come back!"

But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
boat leaped on.

Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull, ███████████ snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they
dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their
bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in
those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in
the same █████████ way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
█████████ in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been
observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried;
and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow
barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect them,--however it was,
they seemed to follow that one boat without █████████ the others.

"Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou yet ring boldly
to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ████████ sharks, and followed by
them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?--For
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure
the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening
and the end of that thing--be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what
is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
expectant,--fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
Mary, girl! thou ██████ in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to
see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
clearing; but clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming? My legs
feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,--beats
it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move!
speak aloud!--Mast-head there! See ye my boy's hand on the
hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--

"Mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he pecks--he
tears the vane"--pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck--"Ha!
he █████ away with it!--Where's the old man now? see'st thou that sight,
oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"

The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads--a
downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little
sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest
silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the
opposing bow.

"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no
hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!"

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly ████████, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as ██████████ with
trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell ████████ back
into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains, then ████████ sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling surface ███████ like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale.

"Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in
him, Moby Dick seemed ██████████ possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven. The wide █████ of welded tendons █████████████ his broad
white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked ███████ together;
as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
███████ them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round
and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,
during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment
██████ to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

The harpoon dropped from his hand.

"████████, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee! I
see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is the
hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those
boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to
me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first thing that but
offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.--Where's the
whale? gone down again?"

But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily
swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,--which thus far had
been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present
her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost
velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
sea.

"Oh! Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
madly ███████ him!"

Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he
leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow
him, not too swiftly, at a █████████ interval. Glancing upwards, he
saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two ██████ boats
which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,
he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, ███████ themselves
on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he
heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving
a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or
flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had
just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer
and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whale's way now began to █████, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start had not been
so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the
unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so ██████████████ stuck to the
boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became
jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost
every dip.

"Heed them not! those teeth but give new ████████ to your oars. Pull on!
'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water."

"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"

"They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--he
muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
Ahab?--But pull on! Aye, all alive, now--we near him. The helm! take the
helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
to the bows of the still flying boat.

At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled
round his great, █████████ hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far ███████ curse into the
hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
into a morass, Moby Dick sideways ███████; spasmodically rolled his nigh
flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly
canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed
into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen--who ████████ not the
precise instant of the dart, and were therefore ██████████ for its
effects--these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of
them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing
wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly
dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.

Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ███████████,
instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and ███, it snapped in the empty air!

"What breaks in me? Some █████ cracks!--'tis whole again; oars! oars!
Burst in upon him!"

Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-████████ boat, the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that █████████,
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his ████████████; bethinking it--it may be--a
larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. "I grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is't night?"

"The whale! The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.

"Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see:
the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?"

But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, █████████ crew, trying
hard to stop the ███ and bale out the pouring water.

Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
with a █████, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
as he.

"The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's
fainting fit. Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the
end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long ██████████? Oh, Ahab,
Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again!
He turns to meet us! Oh, his ████████████ brow drives on towards one,
whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!"

"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb's own █████████
eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a ████████ that is all too
soft; would it were stuffed with █████████! I grin at thee, thou
grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye █████████ of
as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet
ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou
grinning whale, but there'll be plenty of ███████ soon! Why fly ye
not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in
his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;--████████!
cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!"

"Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few ███████ will
now come to her, for the voyage is up."

From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung ████████; hammers,
bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all their
enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely
vibrating his ██████████████ head, sent a broad band of overspreading
semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance,
eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal
man could do, the solid white ████████ of his forehead smote the ship's
starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
faces. Like █████████ trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook
on their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters
pour, as mountain torrents down a █████.

"The ship! The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the boat;
"its wood could only be American!"

Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a
time, he lay quiescent.

"I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer.
Oh! ye three █████████████ spires of mine; thou █████████ keel; and only
god-███████ hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed
prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I
cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh,
lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in
my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in,
ye bold billows of my whole ████████ life, and top this one piled ██████
of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-██████████ but ████████████
whale; to the last I ███████ with thee; from hell's heart I stab at
thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins
and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let
me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee,
thou damned whale! THUS, I give up the spear!"

The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul. Ahab stooped to
clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
neck, and ███████████ as Turkish █████ █████████ their victim, he was
shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty
tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
depths.

For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned. "The
ship? Great God, where is the ship?" Soon they through dim, ███████████
███████ saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the ███████ ████ ███████;
only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by ███████████, or
fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers
still maintained their sinking ████████ on the sea. And now, concentric
circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating
oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, ███████ and █████████, all
round and round in one ██████, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod
out of sight.

But as the last █████████ █████████████ poured themselves over the
sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
which calmly undulated, with ████████ ███████████, over the destroying
billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
hovered ██████████ uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
██████████ had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
among the stars, pecking at the flag, and ███████████ Tashtego there;
this bird now chanced to █████████ its broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that ████████ ██████,
the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen
there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his
imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the
flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
helmeted herself with it.

Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.




████████

"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE" Job.

The drama's done. Why then here does any one step forth?--Because one
did survive the wreck.

It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom the
Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that bowsman
assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
when the █████████ ███████ of the sunk ship reached me, I was then,
but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
circle, like another █████ I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital
centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, █████████ by reason of
its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great
force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and
floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day
and night, I floated on a soft and █████████ main. The unharming sharks,
they glided by as if with ████████ on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks
sailed with ████████ beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer,
and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in
her █████████ search after her missing children, only found another
██████.
